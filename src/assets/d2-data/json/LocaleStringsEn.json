 "WarrivAct1IntroGossip1": "45\nGreetings, stranger. I'm not surprised \nto see your kind here. Many \nadventurers have traveled this way \nsince the recent troubles began.\n \nNo doubt you've heard about the \ntragedy that befell the town of \nTristram. Some say that Diablo, the \nLord of Terror, walks the world again.\n \nI don't know if I believe that, but a Dark \nWanderer did travel this route a few \nweeks ago. He was headed east to the \nmountain pass guarded by the Rogue \nMonastery.\n \nMaybe it's nothing, but evil seems to \nhave trailed in his wake. You see, \nshortly after the Wanderer went \nthrough, the Monastery's Gates to the \npass were closed and strange \ncreatures began ravaging the \ncountryside.\n \nUntil it's safer outside the camp and the \ngates are re-opened, I'll remain here \nwith my caravan. I hope to leave for \nLut Gholein before the shadow that fell \nover Tristram consumes us all.  If \nyou're still alive then, I'll take you \nalong.\n \nYou should talk to Akara, too. She \nseems to be the leader of this camp. \nMaybe she can tell you more.\n",
 "WarrivAct1IntroPalGossip1": "45\nWell met, noble Paladin. It's been a \nwhile since I've seen any of your kind in \nthe west. It would be an honor to aid \nyou in any way that I can.\n \nNo doubt you've heard about the \ntragedy that befell the town of \nTristram.

She \nseems to be the leader of this camp. \nMaybe she can tell you more.\n",
 "WarrivGossip1": "51\nI've been leading my trade caravan \nacross the eastern deserts for more \nthan twenty years now. I've been \nattacked by bandits and outlaws more \ntimes than I can remember. But never \nwhen a Paladin accompanied me. \n \nIndeed, your Order has saved me from \nlosing a small fortune over the years. I \njust hope you can discover what's \ngoing on around here and get the \nGates to the East opened up!\n",
 "WarrivGossip2": "85\nCain seems to have great wisdom \nregarding the supernatural. I hope I \nnever live to be that wise...\n",
 "WarrivGossip3": "58\nAkara is the Rogues' High Priestess. She \nsells the few magic items in her \npossession and can even heal your \nwounds. She is very wise and will help \nyou if she can.\n",
 "WarrivGossip4": "66\nThe fiery Kashya commands the Rogue \narchers in battle. I've only spoken to \nher a few times, though. I get the \nfeeling that she doesn't like outsiders \nvery much.\n",
 "WarrivGossip5": "88\nCharsi seems to be a very sweet girl. \nShe's the smith around here and can \nhelp you by trading weapons and \narmor.\n",
 "WarrivGossip6": "55\nGheed is a wandering merchant of \nquestionable character who is traveling \nalong with my caravan to the East. He \nwill buy and sell most anything.\n \nHe's greedy, but his wares are beyond \nreproach. I would suggest keeping both \neyes open when you deal with him.\n",
 "WarrivGossip7": "71\nTo the east are lands of great \nmystery... and the Jewel City of the \nDesert, Lut Gholein.\n",
 "WarrivGossip8": "68\nI'll gladly take you eastward, if you can \ndrive the Evil from the Monastery.  \nThen, the Rogues may re-open the pass \nthrough the mountains.\n",
 "WarrivGossip9": "70\nIt's easy to become lost in the \nwilderness on the way to the Citadel. \nAfter you have come to the Cairn \nStones, you must remember that the \npath continues through the caves.\n",
 "AkaraIntroGossip1": "35\nI am Akara, High Priestess of the \nSisterhood of the Sightless Eye. I \nwelcome you, traveler, to our camp, \nbut I'm afraid I can offer you but poor \nshelter within these rickety walls.\n \nYou see, our ancient Sisterhood has \nfallen under a strange curse. The \nmighty Citadel from which we have \nguarded the gates to the East for \ngenerations, has been corrupted by the \nevil Demoness, Andariel.\n \nI still can't believe it... but she turned \nmany of our sister Rogues against us \nand drove us from our ancestral home. \nNow the last defenders of the \nSisterhood are either dead or scattered \nthroughout the wilderness.\n \nI implore you, stranger. Please help us. \nFind a way to lift this terrible curse and \nwe will pledge our loyalty to you for all \ntime.\n",
 "AkaraIntroSorGossip1": "34\nGreetings, young Sorceress. It is good \nto see more of your kind at work in the \nworld these dark days. In my opinion, \nthe world needs more women to fight \nagainst the great shadow. But I am \nforgetting my manners... \n \nI am Akara, High Priestess of the \nSisterhood of the Sightless Eye. I \nwelcome you, traveler, to our camp, \nbut I'm afraid I can offer you but poor \nshelter within these rickety walls.\n \nYou see, our ancient Sisterhood has \nfallen under a strange curse.

 "AkaraGossip1": "42\nThe Sisterhood of the Sightless Eye has \na long and distinguished history. Over \nthe generations our Order has become \na deadly fighting force as well as a \nbastion for women who sought to forge \ntheir own destiny.\n \nYet beware, young one, the lure of \npower and knowledge can lead to \ndisaster. I have seen ambition foul the \nbravest of hearts and recklessness dull \nhard-won wisdom.\n \nYou would do well to tread lightly upon \nthe dark path you have chosen to \nexplore.\n",
 "AkaraGossip2": "49\nI understand that Cain is the last \ndescendant of the ancient Horadrim \nand that his knowledge of their lore is \nvast. He could prove to be very useful \nin discerning the nature of our current \ncrisis.\n",
 "AkaraGossip3": "49\nKashya has always been fiercely loyal, \nbut I fear her anger and frustration \nover these recent events will lead her \ninto harm's way. She is highly \nprotective of the few Rogues remaining \nunder her command and will not send \nthem into combat unless there is dire \nneed.\n",
 "AkaraGossip4": "46\nCharsi is young and innocent. However, \nI believe her Barbarian blood thrills to \nthe prospect of adventure and danger. \nShe takes great pride in her work and \nfinds comfort in the fact that her \nweapons and armor are helping to end \nthis evil plague.\n",
 "AkaraGossip5": "48\nThough he has only been our guest for \na short time, I sense that Warriv has \nfaced many harrowing trials. Though \nhe knows, as I do, that a terrible evil \nhas blanketed the land, his only real \nconcern is to reach the eastern trading \nports with his caravan.\n",
 "AkaraGossip6": "53\nTo be honest, I have done my best to \nstay clear of Gheed. He wears \ndishonesty about himself like a cloak \nand seeks only to better his situation \nby preying on the misfortunes of \nothers.\n",
 "AkaraGossip7": "55\nThe wilderness is overrun with Evil and \nthe minions of Hell have taken our \nrightful home. We must purge all Evil \nfrom the Monastery and restore order \nto the world.\n",
 "AkaraGossip8": "53\nI often dream of the day we reclaim our \nown. The Sightless Eye sees through \nthe mist of time a great glory ahead, \nbut how far ahead the Eye cannot \ndiscern.\n",
 "AkaraGossip9": "67\nOur mental discipline is matched only by \nour skill in archery... I only hope these \nare enough to withstand this awful \ntrial.\n",
 "AkaraGossip10": "59\nBeware that you do not suffer the fate \nof the corrupted Rogues. To lose one's \nlife is a tragedy, but to lose one's soul \nis even worse.\n",
 "AkaraGossip11": "41\nEven though the corrupted ones were \nonce of our Order, you need not shy \nfrom slaying them, for they stand \nbetween you and Andariel.\n \nPerhaps, when the Demon Queen is \ndead, our Sisters will return to life, but \nmore likely they will be forever bound \nto their unholy pact.\n",
 "KashyaIntroGossip1": "56\nWelcome, outlander, to our glorious \nhovel. I know you're here to challenge \nthe evil that's driven us from our \nancestral home.\n \nBut, know this. Akara may be our \nspiritual leader, but I command the \nRogues in battle. It will take more than \njust killing a few beasts in the \nwilderness to earn my trust.\n",
 "KashyaIntroAmaGossip1": "55\nWell, well, I never expected to see an \nAmazon in these lands. You're very \nbrave to have come here. Many of my \nfellow Sisters have fallen under some \ndark spell, and if you're not careful you \nmay fall prey to it as well.\n",
 "KashyaGossip1": "60\nWhen I was very young, Akara told me \ntales of the Amazons' fearlessness in \nbattle and of their skills with spears \nand bows. I like to think we Rogues \nhave much in common with you \nAmazons.\n",
 "KashyaGossip2": "64\nSome of my Rogues told me of Deckard \nCain. They said that he is a man of \ngreat wisdom. Personally, I don't know \nhow wise he could possibly be if he \nnever learned how to wage battle \nhimself.\n",
 "KashyaGossip3": "57\nAkara has been like a mother to me for \nas long as I can remember. She is wise \nand good, but I don't think she has the \nsteel to retake our Monastery by force.\n",
 "KashyaGossip4": "89\nI don't trust many outlanders, but \nWarriv seems fine. He never says much \nto me, though.\n",
 "KashyaGossip5": "66\nBefore our exile, Charsi, our blacksmith, \ncould fashion any implement of war.\n \nHere in the camp, she merely makes do. \nHer best tools remain within the \nMonastery.\n",
 "KashyaGossip6": "58\nGheed is a pig. I've been tempted to \nthrow him out of the camp many times, \nbut Charsi seems to think that he's \ngood company. I don't trust the man, \nbut if she's comforted by him, then I'll \ndesist.\n",
 "KashyaGossip7": "76\nIf we could only find out how Andariel \nhas managed to corrupt our Sisters, \nthen, perhaps, we could drive out the \nevil clouding their minds.\n",
 "KashyaGossip8": "68\nIn this camp, those of us who have \nremained true to our Order are forced \nto live among common traders and \nfarm animals.\n \nWelcome to our circle of suffering.\n",
 "KashyaGossip9": "67\nPerhaps Tristram deserved its fate... \nfor letting Evil loose upon the land. I \nonly hope we don't suffer the same.\n",
 "KashyaGossip10": "71\nSome evenings we gather at the bonfire \nto retell epic tales... and try to forget \nabout the terrible events that led to \nlosing the Monastery.\n",
 "CharsiIntroGossip1": "47\nHi there. I'm Charsi, the blacksmith here \nin camp. It's good to see some strong \nadventurers around here.\n \nMany of our Sisters fought bravely \nagainst Diablo when he first attacked \nthe town of Tristram. They came back \nto us true veterans, bearing some \nreally powerful items. Seems like their \nvictory was short-lived, though... Most \nof them are now corrupted by Andariel.\n",
 "CharsiIntroBarGossip1": "54\nWow. You're a Barbarian, huh? It's \nreally great to meet you. I've seen a \nfew of your kind around here lately. I'm \na little jealous... I wish I could go off \nadventuring with you.\n \nOh, by the way... I'm Charsi, the \nblacksmith here in camp.\n",
 "CharsiGossip1": "57\nYou know, I've been with the Sisters for \nas long as I can remember. But Akara \ntold me that my real parents were \nBarbarians from the northern tribes \nand that they were killed when I was \nvery young.\n \nSometimes I wonder what my life would \nhave been like if I had been raised as a \nBarbarian.\n \nI don't know. I love being a blacksmith... \nbut sometimes I just want to get out \nand explore the world, you know?\n",
 "CharsiGossip2": "86\nI don't really know anything about Cain. \nHe seems to have a lot of secrets... \nThat makes me nervous.\n",
 "CharsiGossip3": "51\nOh, Kashya's fantastic. Sure, she's a \nlittle hard on outsiders, but who can \nblame her? All she wants is to protect \nour Order. But now that our Sisters \nhave turned against us... I think this \nwhole mess has hardened her heart.\n",
 "CharsiGossip4": "64\nAkara, our priestess and seer, is most \nupset by the corruption of our Sisters. \nI fear that she blames herself.\n",
 "CharsiGossip5": "80\nWarriv's all right, I guess. He seems too \nserious most of the time. I haven't \nreally talked to him all that much.\n",
 "CharsiGossip6": "60\nOh, I like Gheed. He's very funny. He \nhas all sorts of interesting stories from \nthe places he's been. I wish I could see \nthe sights he has.\n",
 "CharsiGossip7": "84\nI don't know why some of my Sisters \nchose to follow Andariel. Those who \nstrayed were among our finest \nwarriors.\n",
 "GheedIntroGossip1": "48\nGood day to you partner! I'm Gheed and \nI can already tell that I'll be your best \nfriend in this forsaken camp.\n \nA spare weapon, some gold, a small \ngem is all I want in exchange for the \nequipment you'll need on whatever \nquests you might undertake.\n \nNow, now, now... Don't be shy, all of my \nitems are guaranteed for life and come \nwith a two-day warranty!\n",
 "GheedIntroNecGossip1": "46\nA Necromancer! I hoped I'd never have \nto lay my eyes on one of your kind \nagain. ... The recent troubles in this \narea have brought out all kinds, I see. \nNevertheless, your money's good...\n \nA spare weapon, some gold, a small \ngem is all I want in exchange for the \nequipment you'll need on whatever \nquests you might undertake!\n \nNow, now, now... Don't be shy, all of my \nitems are guaranteed for life and come \nwith a two-day warranty!\n",
 "GheedGossip1": "74\nDon't think you can fool me, \nNecromancer. I've seen what your kind \ncan do. If you're involved in any of the \nevil out there, I don't even want to \nknow. Trade quickly and be about your \nbusiness!\n",
 "GheedGossip2": "57\nThat old coot, Cain, is as crazy as a wet \nQuill Rat. I hear he survived whatever \nhappened in Tristram. Personally, I \nwouldn't trust a thing he has to say.\n",
 "GheedGossip3": "55\nAkara and Kashya are Sisters in the \nOrder of the Sightless Eye, but they are \nworlds apart. Akara is a slow river of \nmagic, and Kashya, a viper of war. \nThey're both deeply devoted to their \nreligious order, yet the corruption of \ntheir Sisters pains them both to no \nend.\n",
 "GheedGossip4": "52\nCharsi is a fine girl..., but she has no \nbusiness savvy! I know she means well, \nbut the prices she charges for weapons \nand armor will never earn her a profit.\n \nAs long as I keep filling her mind with \nstories of adventure, she'll never catch \non to the fact that I'm raking in gold \nhand over fist!\n",
 "GheedGossip5": "55\nWarriv was kind enough to let me travel \nwith his caravan, but don't let him drag \nyou into a search for a new Eastern \ntrade route.\n \nI'm making a fortune right here... from \nthe Rogues, of course! You, on the \nother hand, always get my best prices!\n",
 "GheedGossip6": "61\nAndariel's demonic forces have taken up \nresidence in the forests as well as the \nMonastery. Uh-uh. I won't be venturing \nout of the camp. So, if you need \nanything, I'll be right here.\n",
 "GheedGossip7": "58\nWhen - or if - I get to Lut Gholein, I'm \ngoing to find the largest bowl of \nNarlant weed and smoke 'til all earthly \nsense has left my body.\n",
 "CainGossip1": "43\nLong ago, the Soulstones were given to \nthe Horadrim by the Archangel Tyrael. \nThey were used to bind the three Prime \nEvils. I now know that even these holy \nartifacts were no match for Diablo's \npower.\n \nI hope that his two brothers are more \nsecurely held... but I fear the worst.\n",
 "CainGossip2": "54\nIt takes time to master your skills... and \nuse will hone your technique. But take \ncare to choose your new skills wisely.\n",
 "CainGossip3": "52\nYou may recover some mysterious \nthings from the demons you kill. Some \nof great use to you... some of great \nperil! Bring them to me and I'll reveal \ntheir secrets.\n",
 "CainGossip4": "46\nHave I told you about the Horadrim? \nThey were an ancient confederation of \nmage-clans who sought to bind the \nthree Prime Evils for eternity. The \nHoradrim are now nearly forgotten... \nand it appears that the bonds they \nwove are unravelling!\n \nAs the last of the Horadrim, I pray that \nI can help you remedy their failure.\n",
 "CainGossip5": "43\nLong ago, Diablo and his brothers were \ncast out of Hell by the Lesser Evils. It \nseems that Hell's balance has shifted, \nas Andariel is now aligned with the \nLord of Terror. Her presence here in \nthe mortal realm does not bode well for \nus.\n",
 "RogueSignpostGossip1": "90\nTurn back! I can tell that you need more \nexperience to fight safely in the next \nwilderness.\n",
 "RogueSignpostGossip2": "46\nHalt! You should complete Akara's quest \nbefore venturing further. Search for \nthe Den in the wilderness closer to \ncamp.\n",
 "RogueSignpostGossip3": "116\nBeware! The evil is strong ahead.\n",
 "RogueSignpostGossip4": "92\nBeware! Beyond lies mortal danger for \nthe likes of you!\n",
 "RogueSignpostGossip5": "88\nTake care! The Corrupted Rogues in the \nwilderness ahead are not to be trifled \nwith.\n",
 "A1Q1InitAkara": "43\nThere is a place of great evil in the \nwilderness. Kashya's Rogue scouts \nhave informed me that a cave nearby is \nfilled with shadowy creatures and \nhorrors from beyond the grave.\n \nI fear that these creatures are massing \nfor an attack against our encampment. \nIf you are sincere about helping us, \nfind the dark labyrinth and destroy the \nfoul beasts.\n \nMay the Great Eye watch over you.\n",
 "A1Q1AfterInitAkara": "46\nI should add that many Rogue scouts \nhave died in that horrible place. We \ncannot afford to lose any more. If you \nchoose to enter that Den of Evil, you \nmust do so alone.\n",
 "A1Q1AfterInitKashya": "87\nThe demons in that cave have claimed \nmany of my finest archers. I wonder \nhow you will fare!\n",
 "A1Q1AfterInitCharsiMain": "95\nThe beasts from the cave have begun to \nroam throughout the countryside. \nYou'd better be careful out there.\n",
 "A1Q1AfterInitCharsiAlt": "95\nYou seem like a noble warrior. I hope \nyou can help us.\n",
 "A1Q1AfterInitGheed": "67\nYou're a brave soul! I'd sooner thrust \nmy sacred scepter into the foulest, \ncarbuncular trull than set one boot \ninto that cave.\n",
 "A1Q1AfterInitWarriv": "122\nOne who seeks that cave, seeks death.\n",
 "A1Q1EarlyReturnAkara": "85\nYour task is not complete until you have \nkilled all the demons in that cave.\n",
 "A1Q1EarlyReturnKashya": "111\nYou'd better come through on this. Your \nreputation depends on it.\n",
 "A1Q1EarlyReturnCharsi": "148\nYou haven't cleared the cave, yet? Do \nyou need anything?\n",
 "A1Q1EarlyReturnGheed": "73\nDemons still befouling that cave, huh? I \nthink you might need a new weapon.\n",
 "A1Q1EarlyReturnWarriv": "124\nOne who hesitates... does so with good \nreason.\n",
 "A1Q1SuccessfulAkara": "65\nYou have cleansed the Den of Evil. \nYou've earned my trust and may yet \nrestore my faith in humanity.\n \nYour reward is training in the skill of \nyour choice.\n",
 "A1Q1SuccessfulKashya": "74\nHmm. I'm surprised you survived that \ntest, outlander. Go see Akara. She may \nreward you.\n",
 "A1Q1SuccessfulCharsi": "94\nYou are truly brave and skillful...  Akara \nwas worried about you.\n",
 "A1Q1SuccessfulGheed": "87\nThe only good demon is a dead one, I \nsay.\n \nBy the way, did you happen to find \nanything in that cave you'd like to sell?\n",
 "A1Q1SuccessfulWarriv": "120\n...That which does not kill you makes \nyou stronger.\n",
 "A1Q2InitKashya": "56\nMy Rogue scouts have just reported an \nabomination in the Monastery \ngraveyard!\n \nApparently, Andariel is not content to \ntake only our living. Blood Raven, one \nof our finest captains in the battle \nagainst Diablo at Tristram, was also \none of the first to be corrupted by \nAndariel.\n \nNow, you'll find her in the Monastery \ngraveyard raising our dead as \nzombies!\n \nWe cannot abide this defilement! If you \nare truly our ally, you will help us \ndestroy her.\n",
 "A1Q2AfterInitKashya": "80\nDeath has done nothing to weaken \nBlood Raven's combat skills. If \nanything, she's more deadly than ever.\n",
 "A1Q2AfterInitCharsi": "99\nBlood Raven was the leader of a Rogue \nband that once fought Diablo at \nTristram.\n",
 "A1Q2AfterInitGheed": "94\nI'm sorry... The undead are bad for \ntrade. I have a strict no-return policy.\n",
 "A1Q2AfterInitAkara": "51\nBlood Raven fought valiantly against \nDiablo in the catacombs beneath \nTristram... She was never quite the \nsame afterwards. It is now obvious she \nbrought an evil influence back with her.\n",
 "A1Q2AfterInitWarriv": "140\nHmmm...\n \nHow can one kill what is already dead?\n",
 "A1Q2EarlyReturnKashya": "99\nEach moment you delay adds another \nundead Sister to Blood Raven's army.\n",
 "A1Q2EarlyReturnAkara": "70\nIf you fail to destroy Blood Raven, I fear \nthat our Order will perish forever.\n",
 "A1Q2EarlyReturnCharsi": "68\nAkara felt something was wrong even \nbefore Andariel descended upon us. \nShe feared that Blood Raven had \nstumbled upon some evil force beneath \nTristram.\n \nI wish we had acted then...\n",
 "A1Q2EarlyReturnGheed": "77\nI wonder if that old gossip, Melra, is \namong the undead? Oh, she had dirt on \neverybody.\n",
 "A1Q2EarlyReturnWarriv": "86\nWhen the dead return to prey upon the \nliving, it is a terror beyond \nunderstanding.\n",
 "A1Q2SuccessfulKashya": "55\nI can hardly believe that you've defeated \nBlood Raven!\n \nThough she was once my closest friend, \nI pray that her tortured spirit remains \nbanished forever.\n \nYou have earned my respect, stranger... \nand the allegiance of the Rogues. I \nhave placed several of my best \nwarriors at your disposal.\n",
 "A1Q2SuccessfulAkara": "122\nAndariel must be made to pay for her \nsacrilege!\n",
 "A1Q2SuccessfulCharsi": "77\nKashya wishes to reward you for your \ndefeat of Blood Raven. I thank you, \ntoo, even though Blood Raven was once \nmy friend.\n",
 "A1Q2SuccessfulGheed": "148\nSome of those gals weren't so nice the \nfirst time around.\n",
 "A1Q2SuccessfulWarriv": "104\nYou've done well, stranger. I hope all \nyour efforts are worth it.\n",
 "A1Q4InitAkara": "50\nIt is clear that we are facing an Evil \ndifficult to comprehend, let alone \ncombat.\n \nThere is only one Horadrim sage, \nschooled in the most arcane history \nand lore, who could advise us... His \nname is Deckard Cain.\n \nYou must go to Tristram and find him, \nmy friend. I pray that he still lives.\n",
 "A1Q4AfterInitScrollKashya": "90\nThe bark of Inifuss holds mystical \nrunes.\n \nAkara can translate them... into our \nrevenge!\n",
 "A1Q4AfterInitScrollAkara": "42\nTristram is too far to journey by foot...  \nCain would likely be dead, when you \narrived. However, there is a magical \nportal that will take you there \ninstantly.\n \nTo open it, one must stand within the \ncircle of Cairn Stones and touch them \nin a certain order. The proper order \ncan be found in the runes written on \nthe bark of the Tree of Inifuss.\n \nYou must find the sacred Tree of Inifuss \nand bring back its bark. I will translate \nthe runes to unlock the Stones' mystic \npattern.\n",
 "A1Q4AfterInitScrollCharsi": "117\nIf you bring back the bark of Inifuss, \nAkara will tell you how to get to \nTristram.\n",
 "A1Q4AfterInitScrollWarriv": "68\nMonths ago, I came across a few \nsurvivors from Tristram. They said \nthat Cain had gone half-mad and could \nno longer distinguish fact from \nfantasy.\n",
 "A1Q4AfterInitScrollGheed": "98\nI would sooner micturate in a tankard \nof my own ale than journey to \nTristram!\n",
 "A1Q4InstructionsCharsi": "150\nWithout the bark of Inifuss you can't \nfind Cain.\n",
 "A1Q4EarlyReturnSAkara": "76\nHow will you find Cain without going to \nTristram? Finding the Tree of Inifuss is \nthe first step on your journey.\n",
 "A1Q4EarlyReturnSKashya": "96\nThe Tree of Inifuss is hard to find, but \nyou'll know it when you see it.\n",
 "A1Q4EarlyReturnSGheed": "99\nBarking up the wrong tree, huh? You'll \nfind it, just keep looking.\n",
 "A1Q4EarlyReturnSWarriv": "70\nHe who seeks that which cannot be \nfound must look inside himself for \nfurther guidance... or look harder!\n",
 "A1Q4SuccessfulScrollKashya": "82\nWith this scroll you may open a portal \nback to Tristram. Only Akara can \ndecipher its logic.\n",
 "A1Q4SuccessfulScrollCharsi": "168\nGet this to Akara.\n \nOnly she can understand it.\n",
 "A1Q4SuccessfulScrollGheed": "72\nLook, friend... I trade a lot of strange \nitems, but I'm not going to start \ndealing in bark. Okay?\n",
 "A1Q4SuccessfulScrollWarriv": "86\nThis looks like gibberish to me. Akara \nmay know what to make of it.\n",
 "A1Q4InstructionsAkara": "64\nAh, very good. I have translated the \nrunes on this scroll. You must find the \nCairn Stones and touch them in the \norder that I have written.\n",
 "A1Q4EarlyReturnKashya": "103\nDeckard Cain has crucial knowledge \nabout the Evils we face. You must find \nhim!\n",
 "A1Q4EarlyReturnCharsi": "92\nI have heard that Tristram is now in \nruins! Without Cain I fear for the ruin \nof all of us.\n",
 "A1Q4EarlyReturnGheed": "68\nI'm told that Tristram now resembles a \nmead hall... after a Barbarian wedding! \nI will wait here for your most glorious \nreturn.\n",
 "A1Q4EarlyReturnWarriv": "82\nIt is too dangerous to travel to \nTristram. I won't be leaving here until \nthe way is clear!\n",
 "A1Q4EarlyReturnAkara": "64\nIf he still lives, Deckard Cain may be in \ngrave peril! You must hurry to Tristram \nbefore all is lost!\n",
 "A1Q4QuestSuccessfulAkara": "82\nYou have risked your life to rescue \nCain. For that we thank you.\n \nWe must seek his counsel immediately.\n",
 "A1Q4QuestSuccessfulKashya": "78\nAgain, you amaze me, outlander.\n \nThe Sisterhood is grateful to you for \ndelivering Cain to us. I believe Akara \nhas something to tell you.\n",
 "A1Q4QuestSuccessfulGheed": "53\nAh, Cain is here... another customer. I \nhaven't been this pleased since a \nlove-starved maiden let down a bit \nmore than her hair.\n",
 "A1Q4QuestSuccessfulCharsi": "102\nAkara wishes to reward you for your \nbravery in returning Deckard Cain.\n",
 "A1Q4QuestSuccessfulWarriv": "80\nOnly a brave adventurer could return \nwith Deckard Cain. Akara has a reward \nfor your valor.\n",
 "A1Q4QuestSuccessfulCain": "74\nAs a token of my gratitude, I will \nidentify items for you at no charge.\n",
 "A1Q4RescuedByHeroCain": "82\n...I thank you, friend, for coming to my \naid.\n",
 "A1Q4RescuedByRoguesCain": "75\nOh... Blessings on the Rogues! They \nfinally rescued me from that cursed \nplace!\n",
 "A1Q4TragedyOfTristramCain": "33\nRegrettably, I could do nothing to \nprevent the disaster which devastated \nTristram. It would appear that our \ngreatest fears have come to pass. \nDiablo, the Lord of Terror, has once \nagain been set loose upon the world!\n \nAs you know, some time ago Diablo was \nslain beneath Tristram.  And when our \nhero emerged triumphant from the \nlabyrinth beneath town, we held a \ngrand celebration that lasted several \ndays.\n \nYet, as the weeks passed, our hero \nbecame increasingly aloof. He kept his \ndistance from the rest of the townsfolk \nand seemed to lapse into a dark, \nbrooding depression. I thought that \nperhaps his ordeal had been so \ndisturbing that he simply could not put \nit out of his mind.\n \nThe hero seemed more tormented every \npassing day. I remember he awoke \nmany times -- screaming in the night -- \nalways something about 'the East'.\n \nOne day, he simply left. And shortly \nthereafter Tristram was attacked by \nlegions of foul demons. Many were \nslain, and the demons left me to die in \nthat cursed cage.\n \nI believe now that Tristram's hero was \nthat Dark Wanderer who passed this \nway before the Monastery fell.\n \nI fear even worse, my friend... I fear \nthat Diablo has taken possession of the \nhero who sought to slay him. If true, \nDiablo will become more powerful than \never before.\n \nYou must stop him or all will be lost.\n",
 "A1Q5InitQuestTome": "36\n...And so it came to pass that the \nCountess, who once bathed in the \nrejuvenating blood of a hundred \nvirgins, was buried alive... And her \ncastle in which so many cruel deeds \ntook place fell rapidly into ruin. Rising \nover the buried dungeons in that \ngod-forsaken wilderness, a solitary \ntower, like some monument to Evil, is \nall that remains.\n \nThe Countess' fortune was believed to \nbe divided among the clergy, although \nsome say that more remains unfound, \nstill buried alongside the rotting skulls \nthat bear mute witness to the \ninhumanity of the human creature.\n",
 "A1Q5AfterInitGheed": "110\nThe only wealth you're likely to find \nthere is a wealth of vermin.\n",
 "A1Q5AfterInitCharsi": "70\nThat old tower is as rotten on the inside \nas it appears on the outside. I heard \nthat several Sisters came to a \ngruesome end when a stairwell \ncollapsed on them.\n",
 "A1Q5AfterInitAkara": "67\nThe dangers there are not solely \narchitectural. Once inside that \nwretched place, many succumb to a \nvile miasma.\n",
 "A1Q5AfterInitCain": "60\nThat tower marks a place of danger. \nThere is an epic poem about it...  How \nmuch sorrow one can stand was tested \nthere.\n",
 "A1Q5AfterInitWarriv": "81\nRumors of treasure are no different \nfrom rumors of any other kind. They \nhold false promise to those who should \nknow better.\n",
 "A1Q5AfterInitKashya": "78\nThe tome speaks of treasure. Yet, all we \nhave found are death, delirium, and \ndisappointment.\n",
 "A1Q5EarlyReturnKashya": "151\nHave you suddenly lost your taste for \nwealth?\n",
 "A1Q5EarlyReturnCain": "94\nQuickly in and quickly out is all the \nadvice I can give you.\n",
 "A1Q5EarlyReturnWarriv": "118\nBetter an empty pocket than a full \ngrave.\n",
 "A1Q5EarlyReturnCharsi": "170\nYou're not ready to give up, are you?\n",
 "A1Q5EarlyReturnAkara": "140\nThere is no more I can tell you about \nthat ancient tower.\n",
 "A1Q5EarlyReturnGheed": "79\nGuess what! I've named a boil on my \nass after you. It, too, bothers me every \ntime I sit down.\n",
 "A1Q5SuccessfulKashya": "79\nYour rewards are well-earned. To us, \nthe tower was nothing more than a \nheadstone looming over a long \nforgotten grave.\n",
 "A1Q5SuccessfulWarriv": "62\nRemember. Wealth is as insubstantial \nas a cloud and passes as quickly. \nIgnore Gheed. All that twitters is not \nbold.\n",
 "A1Q5SuccessfulGheed": "68\nWarriv's advice is like corpse gas; it \nbefouls the air for a moment and then \nit disappears.\n",
 "A1Q5SuccessfulAkara": "58\nI thought the stories of treasure in the \ntower were nothing but lies. I am glad \nyou found something of value in that \ndeath-trap. Would that our Sisters had \nbeen so fortunate.\n",
 "A1Q5SuccessfulCharsi": "126\nThose riches will serve you well on the \nlong road ahead.\n",
 "A1Q5SuccessfulCain": "69\nWell done, my friend. Courage and \nopportunity together have created in \nyou a kind of alchemy.\n",
 "A1Q3InitCharsi": "66\nWhen I fled the Monastery, I left behind \nthe Horadric Malus, my enchanted \nsmithing hammer. If you can retrieve it \nfor me, I'll use its magic to strengthen \nyour equipment.\n",
 "A1Q3AfterInitCain": "51\nThe Malus was forged and enchanted by \nthe ancient Horadric Mages during the \nSin Wars. When their union dissolved, \nthe Malus was entrusted to the \nSisterhood guarding the pass into the \nEast.\n",
 "A1Q3AfterInitAkara": "59\nThe retrieval of the Horadric Malus is \nnot without risk. Our Monastery is \nfilled with voracious hellspawn. You'd \nbest be careful, my friend.\n",
 "A1Q3AfterInitKashya": "61\nCharsi is wasting her time and talents \nusing an inferior hammer! Had she the \nHoradric Malus, she could make the \nsteel sing and craft you a suit of armor \nas impenetrable as the Great Eye.\n",
 "A1Q3AfterInitCharsi": "87\nThe Monastery can confuse even those \nwho know it well. Stay alert in there.\n",
 "A1Q3AfterInitGheed": "74\nCharsi talks of nothing anymore, but \nthis Horadric Malus. Between you and \nher my ears need a rest.\n \nJust find it and bring it back quickly.\n",
 "A1Q3AfterInitGheedAlt": "74\nI have offered my nomadic phallus, but \nto no avail.\n",
 "A1Q3AfterInitWarriv": "68\nJust as an archer needs bow and arrow, \nor a draughtsman pen and paper, so \nCharsi needs the Horadric Malus with \nwhich to ply her trade.\n",
 "A1Q3EarlyReturnCain": "57\nThe Malus has eluded you so far. Well, \nsearch thoroughly in the Barracks... \nThat is where the Rogues kept their \nforge.\n",
 "A1Q3EarlyReturnAkara": "98\nIf you can't carry out this quest, how \nwill you face the greater evils ahead?\n",
 "A1Q3EarlyReturnKashya": "71\nTo do battle with Andariel requires \nmore than thick skin and a strong will. \nYou'll want armor and weaponry forged \nwith the hammer's enchantments.\n",
 "A1Q3EarlyReturnCharsi": "89\nThe Malus is a Horadric artifact of \ngreat power. Please bring it back.\n",
 "A1Q3EarlyReturnGheed": "90\nI have heard that you bear us no Malus.\n",
 "A1Q3EarlyReturnWarriv": "120\nWhat better opportunity to show your \nmettle?\n",
 "A1Q3SuccessfulCain": "59\nThe magical effects imbued by the \nMalus are impossible to predict, but \nare always to the good.\n",
 "A1Q3SuccessfulAkara": "57\nWell done, my friend. But remember, the \nreturn of the Horadric Malus is but one \nstep in reclaiming the Monastery.\n",
 "A1Q3SuccessfulKashya": "74\nNow that the Horadric Malus is back in \nour possession, we shall use it to \ndeliver a great blow against the Evil \nwhich torments this land.\n",
 "A1Q3SuccessfulCharsi": "72\nOh! Thanks so much for returning the \nHoradric Malus! I will now imbue one of \nyour items with magical powers.\n",
 "A1Q3SuccessfulGheed": "120\nI guess it's too late to take back some \nof the names I called you.\n",
 "A1Q3SuccessfulWarriv": "118\nI am glad the hammer has returned and \nyou with it.\n",
 "A1Q6InitCain": "34\nIt is certain that we face the demon \nqueen, Andariel, who has corrupted the \nRogue Sisterhood and defiled their \nancestral Monastery. This does not \nbode well for us, my friend.\n \nAncient Horadric texts record that \nAndariel and the other Lesser Evils \nonce overthrew the three Prime Evils -- \nDiablo, Mephisto and Baal -- banishing \nthem from Hell to our world. Here, they \ncaused mankind untold anguish and \nsuffering before they were finally \nbound within the Soulstones.\n \nAndariel's presence here could mean \nthat the forces of Hell are once again \naligned behind Diablo and his Brothers. \nIf this is true, then I fear for us all.\n \nYou must kill her before the Monastery \nbecomes a permanent outpost of Hell \nand the way east lost forever.\n",
 "A1Q6AfterInitCain": "45\nDiablo is heading east for some foul \npurpose. And the only passage east is \nthrough the Monastery gate. \nObviously, Diablo summoned Andariel \nto block any pursuit.\n \nFor her part Andariel hopes to win \nDiablo's favor... the lesser demons are \nalways vying for positions of power \nwithin the unholy hierarchy!\n",
 "A1Q6AfterInitAkara": "63\nAndariel has desecrated all we hold \ndear. She must not be permitted to \nserve Diablo.\n \nDestroy her! Her corruption of our \nOrder must be undone!\n",
 "A1Q6AfterInitCharsi": "132\nSend Andariel back to the Hell she came \nfrom!\n",
 "A1Q6AfterInitGheed": "71\nYou're going after Andariel?\n \n... One of my wagon wheels is in need of \nrepair. I'll be under the wagon, if I'm \nneeded.\n",
 "A1Q6AfterInitWarriv": "72\nThe mapmakers tell us the shortest \ndistance between two points is a \nstraight line.\n \nOur way east is a line that runs through \nAndariel's stronghold, the Monastery.\n",
 "A1Q6AfterInitKashya": "81\nI can imagine a thousand different ways \nto kill Andariel. You need only choose \none.\n",
 "A1Q6EarlyReturnCain": "48\nIt is clear that Andariel is acting on \nbehalf of Diablo to prevent anyone \nfrom following him eastward. Her \ndefeat would allow you to continue the \npursuit.\n \nAncient lore has it that while Andariel \nwas spawned in the Burning Hells, she \nis not fond of fire.\n",
 "A1Q6EarlyReturnAkara": "57\nYou have done much to help us, but I \nsense that this has only fueled \nAndariel's fury. She will not stop until \nwe are all dead.\n \nYou must kill Andariel before her army \ncan gain the upper hand.\n",
 "A1Q6EarlyReturnGheed": "72\nHave you stumbled upon that Demon \nQueen, yet? I hear she's quite the \nbeauty... as far as Maidens of Anguish \ngo, that is.\n",
 "A1Q6EarlyReturnCharsi": "108\nIf you are the hero that you seem to be, \nnow is the time to prove it.\n",
 "A1Q6EarlyReturnWarriv": "90\nMay I remind you that my caravan can \nonly go east, if the Monastery is \ncleansed?\n",
 "A1Q6EarlyReturn2Kashya": "126\nDeckard Cain has important information \nabout Andariel.\n",
 "A1Q6SuccessfulAkara": "64\nFinally, we may rejoice!\n \nWe owe you a debt we can never repay. \nI only hope that in time we will be able \nto rebuild our Order.\n \nAll our thanks go with you, my friend.\n",
 "A1Q6SuccessfulCharsi": "86\nYou'll probably go east now... It was \ngood to know you. I hope you'll come \nback if you ever need anything.\n",
 "A1Q6SuccessfulKashya": "44\nAndariel's death brings about renewed \nlife for us all. We mourn the loss of our \ndear Sisters, but at least now we can \nget on with our lives.\n \nI... may have misjudged you, outlander. \nYou are a true hero and testament to \nthe noble spirit which has inspired our \nOrder for generations.\n \nFare well... my friend.\n",
 "A1Q6SuccessfulGheed": "100\nI'm going to party like it's 999!\n",
 "A1Q6SuccessfulWarriv": "82\nThe caravan is prepared. We may now \njourney eastward to Lut Gholein.\n",
 "A1Q6SuccessfulCain": "38\nThis is a great victory indeed, but many \nmore battles await. I will accompany \nyou on your journey, lending what \nassistance I can... \n \nRemember... Diablo is still out there, \nseeking something in the desert. I'm \nafraid that this nightmare will not end \nuntil you find what it is that he seeks.\n",
 "PalaceGuardGossip1": "600\nHalt.\n",
 "PalaceGuardGossip2": "290\nYou may not pass.\n",
 "PalaceGuardGossip3": "255\nWelcome to the palace.\n",
 "PalaceGuardGossip4": "255\nYou may enter the palace.\n",
 "PalaceGuardGossip5": "290\nStay out of trouble.\n",
 "GriezIntroGossip1": "58\nI'll bet you wonder how this town \nmanages to stay safe with all the \ntrouble going on out in the desert. \nWell, I can tell you that it's got nothing \nto do with the local town guards... \nthey're all in the palace for some \nreason.\n \nJerhyn hired me and my mercenaries to \nhelp keep the peace around here. We're \nnot cheap, but we're the best this \nwasteland has to offer.\n",
 "GriezGossip1": "85\nWe do a good job in town, but beyond \nthe city gates, you'll find all manner of \ndemons.\n",
 "GriezGossip2": "52\nThe local guards were all relocated to \nthe palace after the troubles began. No \none really knows why. Actually, all of \nthe town's brothel girls have been \nhiding out in the palace's cellar lately, \nso I assume that the guards have been \nassigned to 'protect them' with their \nlives.\n",
 "GriezGossip3": "75\nI might spare you a few of my men. \nWhy, enough gold can muster an army.\n",
 "GriezGossip4": "61\nJerhyn's got a nice little trading post \ngoing here. Despite his youth, he is a \nclever businessman. As you can see by \nthat palace, he's done quite well for \nhimself.\n",
 "GriezGossip5": "99\nWe're keeping the town safe and tight, \nbut I've got a hunch there's something \nJerhyn's not telling us.\n",
 "GriezGossip6": "44\nAh, Elzix is quite a character. I had a \nfew run-ins with his band of outlaws in \nmy younger years. Now, he's as settled \nas the dunes out there. The Desert Rain \nInn is his pride and joy these days.\n",
 "GriezGossip7": "53\nAtma seems to be a fine woman. But I'm \nsure the loss of her family has made \nher lonely. Perhaps I should go over \nand console her when I get off duty \ntonight...\n",
 "GriezGossip8": "72\nGeglash is an imposing warrior, but he's \nnever been able to back down from a \nfight. One of these days, his pride will \nbe the death of him.\n",
 "GriezGossip9": "67\nMeshif has sailed all around the \nsouthern seas and visited many \nstrange lands. It must be driving him \nmad, having to stay anchored here.\n",
 "GriezGossip10": "70\nI haven't talked much to Fara. She \nkeeps to herself most of the time. I get \nthe feeling that she doesn't like us \nmercenary types much.\n",
 "GriezGossip11": "73\nI'd stay clear of Lysander, if I were you. \nHe's always mixing his damned potions \nand chemicals. I wouldn't be surprised \nif he winds up blowing himself to \nsmithereens!\n",
 "GriezGossip12": "85\nDrognan's a mystery to me. Then again, \nI never did trust mages much.\n",
 "ElzixIntroGossip1": "61\nHmm... You look like a sturdy \nadventurer.\n \nYou know, I used to be quite the \nscoundrel in my day. I led the fiercest \ngroup of bandits who ever terrorized \nthese sands!\n \nNowadays, I run this here Inn and \npretty much stay out of trouble.\n \nMy days of adventuring are behind me.\n",
 "ElzixIntroNecGossip1": "48\nAh... You must be one of the new \nheroes who've come to rid our city of \nevil. Under any other circumstances, I'd \nbe surprised to see one of your kind in \nthe city. But lately... Oh, never mind all \nthat...\n \nYou know, I used to be quite the \nscoundrel in my day. I led the fiercest \ngroup of bandits who ever terrorized \nthese sands!\n \nNowadays, I run this here Inn and \npretty much stay out of trouble.\n \nMy days of adventuring are behind me.\n",
 "ElzixGossip1": "52\nYou know, I've lost a number of body \nparts over the years. An eye here, a leg \nthere...\n \nSay, do you know any spells that'd grow \nthem back for me? Hmm... On second \nthought, I'll leave well enough alone.\n",
 "ElzixGossip2": "90\nWhat tales Drognan can tell... You \nwould do well to listen carefully to that \nwizened wizard.\n",
 "ElzixGossip3": "80\nThere are many ancient tombs in the \ndesert. Most of them are already \nplundered, but I imagine that some \nhave remained hidden.\n",
 "ElzixGossip4": "67\nI miss the brothels that used to do \nbusiness here.\n \nYou know, all of the ladies fled to the \npalace as soon as the trouble in the \ndesert started. You'd think that they \ncould at least come out once in a while \nnow that Greiz and his men have things \nrelatively under control.\n",
 "ElzixGossip5": "71\nAtma... Now, there's a fine woman. \nLately, though, she's only thinking \nabout revenge. She has reason \nenough...\n",
 "ElzixGossip6": "71\nWe've all fared well under Jerhyn's \nleadership. The town has remained \nsafe throughout this whole mess; and \nyet the lad still seems very upset about \nsomething.\n",
 "ElzixGossip7": "88\nGeglash is a fool who would fight his \nown shadow if he could. Fighting's all \nhe ever thinks about!\n",
 "ElzixGossip8": "74\nMeshif is a wise Captain, I think. Wise \nenough to know silver from tin and \ntruth from dung, that's for sure.\n",
 "ElzixGossip9": "65\nFara is a good woman. She seems very \nsad, but seldom speaks of her past. \nShe's good to the poor and helps \npeople when she can. That makes her \nall right in my book.\n",
 "ElzixGossip10": "70\nThat Lysander's a grumpy old cuss. \nYou'd better not disturb him while he's \nworking on his potions, or... BOOM! \nYou could get blasted to the moon.\n",
 "WarrivAct2IntroGossip1": "62\nNow that Andariel is dead, I can return \nand outfit the Rogues properly. Once \nI've made some trades here, I'll be free \nto head back to their Monastery. Let \nme know if you want to travel along.\n",
 "WarrivAct2Gossip1": "106\nCaravans take people where they want \nto go - until they get there.\n",
 "WarrivAct2Gossip2": "80\nBy ship is the only way eastward from \nhere. I believe Captain Meshif has a \nsmall trading vessel moored at the \ndocks.\n",
 "WarrivAct2Gossip3": "70\nThere used to be a lot of brothels \nhere... I guess the troubles scared all \nthe women away, or maybe they're \n'safe' in Jerhyn's palace.\n",
 "WarrivAct2Gossip4": "53\nThat old desert fox, Elzix, is as crafty \nas they come. Years back, he made off \nwith a small fortune of my caravan's \nwares. I certainly never expected to see \nhim so... domesticated.\n",
 "WarrivAct2Gossip5": "57\nJerhyn has his father's strength and \nwits. He's young, but he rules this \nplace with wisdom and care. I think \nhe'll grow into a fine Sultan... Provided \nwe all survive this crisis.\n",
 "AtmaIntroGossip1": "59\nYou'll forgive me if I seem upset. I've \nsuffered a loss recently, but that's not \nyour problem.\n \nIt's a relief to see some proper warriors \ncome through here. My name is Atma. I \nrun the tavern here in Lut Gholein.\n",
 "AtmaGossip1": "86\nEvil has laid siege to Lut Gholein and \nyou may be our last hope...\n",
 "AtmaGossip2": "56\nThis public house used to be quite lively, \nuntil this plague of evil. Luckily, I've \nmanaged to save away a tidy nest egg. \nUnfortunately, I couldn't save \neverything I cared for...\n",
 "AtmaGossip3": "57\nIn addition to my public house, there \nused to be several brothels doing \nbusiness here. When the troubles first \nstarted in the desert, the harem guilds \nsought sanctuary within the palace.\n \nOf course, Jerhyn was glad to oblige. I'll \nbet they're finding many ways to repay \nhim for his protection.\n",
 "AtmaGossip4": "70\nGeglash may seem like a sot, but he's a \nbrave man. All this trouble has driven \nhim to drinking more than his usual.\n",
 "AtmaGossip5": "64\nElzix and I have reached an \nunderstanding over the years. He \nsends travelers to me for drink and \nentertainment, and I send them back to \nhim for a soft bed. The travelers often \ntrade their wares for lodging.\n",
 "AtmaGossip6": "89\nMeshif seldom patronizes my \nestablishment. I think he prefers to \nstay out there on his leaky ship.\n",
 "AtmaGossip7": "71\nOh, Lysander is cranky, but he's a good \nold man. He used to give me medicines \nwhen... my son was ill.\n",
 "AtmaGossip8": "78\nDrognan is a very private person. He's \nalways studying ancient scrolls and \nsuch. He may be a mystery to me \nforever.\n",
 "GeglashIntroGossip1": "57\nBah! I don't know why you people keep \npestering me.\n \nGreiz seems to have this place locked \ndown nice and tight. Not that I couldn't \nhave done the same! I've proven my \nvalor in combat plenty of times.\n",
 "GeglashIntroBarGossip1": "43\nHey, you're a Barbarian, aren't ya? \nFerocious as the wild beasts of the \nnorth, that's what they say. I suppose \nyou've come to help save this city. You \nneedn't bother.\n \nGreiz seems to have this place locked \ndown nice and tight. Not that I couldn't \nhave done the same! I've proven my \nvalor in combat plenty of times.\n",
 "GeglashGossip1": "46\nHey, I heard that you Barbarians can \nwield multiple weapons at once. I never \nlearned to fight two-handed. Carrying a \nsword and a wineskin at the same time \nis all I can ever handle.\n",
 "GeglashGossip2": "53\nSure, I hear lots of what goes on. Did \nyou hear about the harem guilds? They \nwere the only ones allowed to hide out \nin the palace when the raids started!\n \nAh... It figures.\n",
 "GeglashGossip3": "64\nI've killed plenty of those demons out in \nthe desert. It doesn't seem to slow \nthem down any, though... they just \nkeep coming back for more.\n",
 "GeglashGossip4": "55\nHave you found those big sand maggots \nyet? Arrows and all that don't work so \nwell against them. Best thing is to hack \n'em with a sword or such.\n",
 "GeglashGossip5": "58\nThere are some ancient tombs out there \nin the desert. You have to go pretty far \nto find them, though. Rumor has it that \nthey're crawling with walking corpses \nnow.\n \nAs if the Saber Cats and Claw Vipers \nweren't bad enough.\n",
 "GeglashGossip6": "67\nYeah. Meshif's okay, I guess. But I'll be \ndamned if I ever get on his ship. I don't \neven like to drink water.\n",
 "GeglashGossip7": "52\nJerhyn's been acting strange lately. I \ncan't imagine why he recalled the town \nguards into the palace. If there is \nsomething wrong in there, I hope he \ndoesn't expect me to handle it.\n",
 "GeglashGossip8": "57\nI've seen Fara defend herself against a \nfew drunken ruffians. She's got moves \nI've never even seen before. Wherever \nshe's from, she sure learned how to \nfight there.\n",
 "GeglashGossip9": "83\nI've got no time for old alchemists. \nLysander would be completely useless \nin a real fight.\n",
 "MeshifIntroGossip1": "63\nGreetings. I'm Meshif, captain of this \nship here. I make port runs around the \nTwin Seas and occasionally out to \nKingsport in Westmarch.\n \nI haven't sailed anywhere lately, \nthough... Jerhyn has ordered me to \nstay docked here in case of emergency.\n",
 "MeshifIntroAmaGossip1": "54\nGreetings, Amazon. I haven't seen one \nof your kind in many years.... It's good \nto know that warriors of your caliber \nare protecting this city.\n \nI'm Meshif, captain of this ship here. I \nmake port runs around the Twin Seas \nand occasionally out to Kingsport in \nWestmarch.\n \nI haven't sailed anywhere lately, \nthough... Jerhyn has ordered me to \nstay docked here in case of emergency.\n",
 "MeshifGossip1": "62\nI was wondering if you've heard any \nnews from Kurast? I know you \nAmazons travel extensively. Have you \nbeen there recently?\n \nHmm... Well, I hope the port opens \nsoon. I need to get home to Kurast and \nfind out what's been happening there.\n",
 "MeshifGossip2": "72\nThere's something Jerhyn's not telling \nme, I just don't know what. To my eye, \nthings here in town don't look that bad, \nespecially since Warriv's caravan route \nopened up.\n",
 "MeshifGossip3": "65\nI've been all around the seas in these \nparts. It's dangerous sailing west this \ntime of year, though. Until the season \nchanges, the caravan through the \ndesert is the main trade route to \nWestmarch.\n",
 "MeshifGossip4": "75\nMy ship is the only way East from here. \nStill, Lord Jerhyn tells me that I may \nnot leave until the current crisis is \nover.\n",
 "MeshifGossip5": "65\nOh, I've known Elzix for years. He \nalways offers me a free room at his Inn \nwhen I dock here, but I prefer the \ncomforts of my own cabin.\n",
 "MeshifGossip6": "61\nWarriv is a good friend. We've shared \nmany tales, he and I. If we had it all to \ndo over again, I believe we'd both be \nexplorers of some renown.\n",
 "MeshifGossip7": "69\nGreiz seems to be a dependable fellow. I \nhope he can handle it if those things in \nthe desert decide to attack this town.\n",
 "MeshifGossip8": "130\nAtma serves a fine ale in her \nestablishment.\n",

 "JerhynActIntroGossip1": "41\nGreetings, honored traveler. I am \nJerhyn, Lord of Lut Gholein, and I bid \nyou welcome to my fair port-city. I'm \nglad to know that once again caravans \nare free to travel through the Western \nPass.\n \nFor some time now, we have been under \nsiege by an evil power that I cannot \nidentify. Strange... It all began when a \nDark Wanderer came this way, looking \nfor the Tomb of Tal Rasha. No one \nknows exactly where Tal Rasha, Keeper \nof Baal, is entombed, but it is certain \nto be far out in the desert.\n \nNow, my people whisper tales of the \ndead rising from their tombs and \nhorrible creatures lurking amongst the \nmoonlit dunes. Even I have witnessed \nthings which I cannot explain. I've \nordered the port closed and all trade \nships moored until I am sure that my \ncity is safe.\n \nAtma, the tavernkeeper, has an \nimportant mission for you. Go see her \nimmediately. You'll find her on the \nother side of town.\n \nNow, I must return to the palace. I \napologize, but I can't invite you in. \nThings are... rather a mess right now.\n",
 "JerhynActIntroMoreGossip1": "51\nFor trade in magic and the like, see \nDrognan or Lysander. Drognan is the \nwisest man I know - without equal in \nmagic and ancient lore. Poor Lysander \nis nearly deaf, but he's a reliable potion \nchemist.\n \nFor travel back west, see Warriv, whom \nyou already know.\n \nOur own Fara is a fine and honest \narmorer, and she can heal wounds as \nwell.\n \nElzix is the Innkeeper and may also \nhave some items to trade.\n \nGreiz, the mercenary captain I hired to \nsecure the gates of Lut Gholein, keeps \norder in town, as well.\n \nThere are others here, too. I'm sure \nyou'll meet most of them. Just look \naround...\n",

 "JerhynGossip2": "63\nTo any who aid me in the defense of Lut \nGholein, I pledge my support. Passage \nEast, wealth, honor - all are due to \nthose who help my city.\n",
 "JerhynGossip3": "71\nYou seem very capable, but no offense \nis intended when I say that I must \nchoose my confidants carefully. It \nwouldn't do to have rumors sending \neveryone into a panic.\n",
 "JerhynGossip4": "87\nEven though he was once a bandit, I \npermitted Elzix to take over the Desert \nRain Inn. He has been quite civilized \never since.\n",
 "JerhynGossip5": "76\nWhen you arrived, Warriv's caravan had \nbeen long overdue. With all of the evil \nthat's arisen in the land, I'm surprised \nhe got through at all.\n",
 "JerhynGossip6": "77\nMeshif is an honorable man, but I fear \nthat he is growing impatient with me \nabout impounding his ship. I dare not \ntell him what's really happening in this \ncity.\n",
 "JerhynGossip7": "98\nThe woman, Atma, may have some \nuseful gossip for you. She can always \nbe found near her public house.\n",
 "FaraIntroGossip1": "81\nI know much about the ancient \nreligions. I was trained as a Paladin of \nZakarum in the Eastern Kurast temple \nmany years ago.\n",
 "FaraIntroPalGossip1": "103\nWelcome, brother Paladin.\n \nI am Fara. I was once a devout \nchampion of Zakarum.\n",
 "FaraGossip1": "67\nPerhaps, in time, you will play a part in \nreclaiming our Order's honor and \nspirit. You are an inspiration to me, \nbrother Paladin.\n",
 "FaraGossip2": "60\nThe shrines in the desert are leftover \nartifacts from the great Sin War that \nravaged these lands almost a thousand \nyears ago. They still function, but most \ntravelers believe them only to be \nremnants of the distant past.\n",
 "FaraGossip3": "54\nI've no love for brothels, as they can \nlead honorable men to do dishonorable \nthings. Since the local harems took up \nhiding in the palace, however, there \nseems to be a rise in foul tempers.\n",
 "FaraGossip4": "66\nWhen the Three Evils were bound ages \nago, Mephisto, the Lord of Hatred, was \nmoved to Kurast and bound by the \nholiest of magics.\n",
 "FaraGossip5": "79\nWarriv may not remember me, but I \nhelped him out when I was a young \nPaladin. There's no need for me to \nremind him. The rewards for honor will \nnot come in this life.\n",
 "FaraGossip6": "68\nGreiz is a fine warrior and leader, but in \nhis heart, he will always be a \nmercenary for hire. I cannot be loyal to \nthose who have no loyalty to \nthemselves.\n",
 "FaraGossip7": "90\nAtma is a good, loving woman. But I \nfear she will succumb to her despair \nand hatred.\n",
 "FaraGossip8": "95\nGeglash is too confident in his abilities. \nA warrior's true strength is in his \nheart.\n",
 "FaraGossip9": "94\nMeshif is an honest man as far as I can \ntell. He has never pestered me about \nmy past.\n",
 "LysanderIntroGossip1": "61\nHow do I know I can trust you? Hmm?\n \nYou may be as shifty as that pack rat, \nElzix, who runs the Inn. But, if you \nneed a potion, though, I suppose I can \nmake you one... for a price, of course.\n",
 "LysanderGossip1": "109\nPotions are delicate mixtures. They're \njust as liable to go off in your face as \nanything.\n",
 "LysanderGossip2": "65\nAh... The sweetest desert flower - that's \nAtma. Even my strongest brew can't \nbring back her family, though.\n",
 "LysanderGossip3": "86\nThere are some ancient enchanted \nfountains in the desert that can heal \nyour wounds - if you drink enough from \nthem.\n",
 "LysanderGossip4": "71\nOh. Deafness has its advantages, you \nknow. I'm no longer forced to overhear \nthe tedious gossip of others.\n",
 "LysanderGossip5": "54\nI never patronized the brothels, mind \nyou. But since those ladies took up \nhiding in the palace, there certainly has \nbeen less scenery to feast my eyes on.\n",
 "LysanderGossip6": "95\nOh... I have great faith in Greiz. He \nseems to have things well in hand.\n",
 "LysanderGossip7": "90\nI've traded my potions to Warriv many \ntimes. Yes. They seem to fetch a good \nprice in the western lands.\n",
 "LysanderGossip8": "71\nI've sold many sea-sickness potions to \nMeshif over the years. It seems that \nmany of his passengers don't take well \nto the rocking of his ship on the open \nseas.\n",
 "LysanderGossip9": "58\nOh... Young Jerhyn used to purchase \nminor love potions from me, hoping to \nwin the favors of the harem girls.\n \nBut now that the girls have taken up \nresidence in the palace, he doesn't \ncome around here anymore. Well, \nwell... I've always said, 'alchemy is no \nsubstitute for experience'.\n",
 "LysanderGossip10": "57\nDrognan? Oh.. He's a good friend of \nmine. I help him find exotic spell \ncomponents and alchemical books from \ntime to time. I think he used to be a \nsorcerer of great renown, but he \ndoesn't like to talk about his past.\n",
 "DrognanIntroGossip1": "61\nI've heard that you are responsible for \nbanishing Andariel back to the Burning \nHells. I'm impressed, stranger. That \ncouldn't have been easy.\n \nMy name is Drognan and I know what \nyou're up against, my friend.\n \nYou ought to look over my inventory of \nitems for trade.\n",
 "DrognanIntroSorGossip1": "50\nWelcome, young Sorceress, to Lut \nGholein. I hope your skills are a match \nfor the horrors that lie beyond the \ncity's walls. A mage of your limited \nexperience may find the evil too great \nto withstand alone.\n \nMy name is Drognan and I know what \nyou're up against, my friend.\n \nYou ought to look over my inventory of \nitems for trade.\n",
 "DrognanGossip1": "74\nMany of the Mage Clans feel that \nwomen shouldn't practice magic \nopenly. But since you've made it this \nfar, I must say that you have proven \nyour right to do so.\n",
 "DrognanGossip2": "57\nThe Horadrim were a powerful Order, \nalthough maybe too prideful. Tal Rasha \nwas one of their Order. And that \nshould tell you something.\n \nAny man who believes himself strong \nenough to contain one of the Prime \nEvils is in for a rude awakening, I \nshould think.\n",
 "DrognanGossip3": "78\nI have heard of your friend, Cain. He is \nthe last of the Horadrim. You would do \nwell to heed whatever advice he has to \ngive you.\n",
 "DrognanGossip4": "53\nNot long ago, one of my Vizjerei \ncomrades, who I believed had died in \nTristram, came to this city. He seemed \nquite insane, so I dismissed much of \nwhat he said.\n \nHowever, he was able to talk his way \ninto Jerhyn's palace. No one has seen \nhim since. I fear that fool may have \nfound something in the palace that led \nto his doom.\n",
 "DrognanGossip5": "68\nI've been practicing magic for more \nyears than you could know. I'm older \nthan I look, though not so old that I \ncan't conjure up a few sparks.\n",
 "DrognanGossip6": "67\nElzix is a sly one, I'll give him that. Of \ncourse, he never tries to cheat me. He \nknows what my magic skills can do.\n",
 "DrognanGossip7": "86\nDemons have spread throughout the \ndesert wasteland and threaten to \nengulf our quiet port-city.\n",
 "DrognanGossip8": "88\nMeshif and his vessel should remain \nhere, lest we risk taking demonic \nstowaways to other lands.\n",
 "DrognanGossip9": "58\nWhen the recent troubles began, Lord \nJerhyn came seeking my council. I \nadvised him to close the port and put \nthe town under strict watch.\n \nLately, though, he's been occupied \nwithin the palace. I doubt his whores \ncould divert him from his civic duties \nfor this long, though.\n",
 "DrognanGossip10": "68\nLysander is harmless enough. We keep \neach other company with our mutual \ninterests, yet I don't think he could \nhandle the enormity of our present \nsituation.\n",
 "CainAct2Gossip1": "48\nGreetings, my friend. Have you spoken \nto Jerhyn yet? He's quite a remarkable \nleader for being such a young man. \nThen again, the old blood has always \nrun strong in this land.\n",
 "CainAct2Gossip2": "71\nThere is something about Fara that \ntroubles me. Her manner is strange for \na lonely desert-maid.\n",
 "CainAct2Gossip3": "70\nElzix is quite a scoundrel, but I like him \nall the same.\n",
 "CainAct2Gossip4": "59\nI talked at length with Warriv as we \ncrossed the desert from Khanduras. He \nhas many fascinating tales of the \ndangers in the desert. His experience \nmay be useful to you.\n",
 "CainAct2Gossip5": "57\nMeshif is an interesting man. Part of \nhim longs for the freedom of the open \nseas... Yet his heart belongs in his \nhomeland.\n",
 "TyraelGossip1": "42\nI thank you, mortal, for my freedom. \nBut I did expect you earlier.\n \nI am the Archangel Tyrael. I came here \nto prevent Diablo from freeing his \nbrother, Baal. But I have failed. Now, \nTerror and Destruction roam free \nthroughout your world.\n \nEven now, they head towards the \nEastern capital of Kurast - to the very \nheart of the Zakarum Temple. There \nthey hope to find their eldest brother, \nMephisto, the Lord of Hatred who was \nimprisoned there ages ago.\n \nIf the three Prime Evils unite, they will \nbe invincible. Though it is unclear as to \nwhat their aims are, it is certain that \nthey must be stopped at all costs.\n \nI am broken and the energies that tie \nme to this world are diminishing \nrapidly.\n \nYou must take up this quest and \nprevent the Three Brothers from \nreuniting. You must cross the sea and \nsearch for Diablo and Baal in Kurast.\n \nNow hurry, mortal... Time is running \nout for all of us!\n",
 "Desert2GuardGossip1": "50\nHey, hero! You're asking for trouble, if \nyou leave town now.\n",
 "A2Q1InitAtma": "50\nI don't expect this of you, but if you \nwant to help me, I would be grateful.\n \nIn the sewers below our city, there lurks \na horrid creature that hungers for \nhuman flesh. The creature has killed \nmany, including my son and my \nhusband.\n \nIf you destroy it, I will reward you. \nPlease be careful though, that beast \nhas taken enough from us already.\n \nThe sewer entrance is through the trap \ndoor just up the street.\n",
 "A2Q1AfterInitGreiz": "52\nI've personally found some of that \ndevil's victims washed up out of the \nsewer. Often, they are missing limbs or \na head, and their bodies have always \nbeen skinned.\n \nAt first the creature raided the town at \nnight... That's how Atma lost her \nfamily. Now we've got him barricaded \nin the sewers.\n \nYou're safe up here on the surface, but \nevery now and again some fool wants \nto be a hero and heads down to the \nwaste tunnels with a pig-sticker.\n",
 "A2Q1AfterInitElzix": "68\nI hear that the creature kills his victims \nin order to hack off their limbs! I guess \nthat makes me a less likely candidate, \neh?\n",
 "A2Q1AfterInitWarrivAct2": "84\nI've heard tales of walking corpses out \nin the desert at night, though I've never \nactually seen one.\n",
 "A2Q1AfterInitGeglash": "77\nHey... Don't touch my drink or I'll bore a \nhole into your skull with my thumb.\n",
 "A2Q1AfterInitFara": "54\nI believe that the creature you refer to \nis one of the ancient Horadric \nmummies from the tombs that lie \nburied beneath the desert sands. It is \nunusual for one of his kind to be so far \naway from his resting place. I sense in \nthis entity a restless and malevolent \nspirit.\n",
 "A2Q1AfterInitAtma": "62\nThe creature makes its lair in the \ntunnels beneath this city. He butchered \nmy husband and son... I simply cannot \nbear to talk about it...\n",
 "A2Q1AfterInitMeshif": "63\nThere are two entrances to the sewers, \nI believe. One of them is right near \nhere, down by the water beneath the \ndocks. I can see it from my ship, and \nyou can bet I keep an eye on it every \nnight.\n",
 "A2Q1AfterInitDrognan": "53\nFara and I have been talking about the \ncreature recently. From my studies, I \nhave deduced that it is Radament the \nFallen, an ancient Horadric mummy \nthat has for some reason left his tomb \nto prey on mortals.\n \nI'm doing some more research now. If \nyou check back later, I may have some \nmore insight as to his nature.\n",
 "A2Q1AfterInitLysander": "94\nI hear that beast is after body parts. \nDoes he eat them? Oooh... Ghastly!\n",
 "A2Q1AfterInitCain": "48\nThe Horadrim used to mummify their \nhighest mages, and infuse them with \nspells that would allow them to protect \ntheir tombs, even after death.\n \nI have no idea why one of them would \nbe acting so malevolently. Perhaps \nDrognan or Fara would know more \nabout this.\n",
 "A2Q1EarlyReturnWarrivAct2": "90\nDeath is not afraid of the living, but the \nliving abhor death.\n",
 "A2Q1EarlyReturnMeshif": "55\nI noticed a rotting, human arm floating \nin the harbor this morning. I suspected \nfoul play, so I told Greiz. He didn't \nseem too concerned since there haven't \nbeen any folk reported missing lately.\n",
 "A2Q1EarlyReturnAtma": "83\nI am starting to have second thoughts \nabout my request... I couldn't bear the \nthought of you losing your life on my \nbehalf.\n \nPlease be careful.\n",
 "A2Q1EarlyReturnGreiz": "69\nWe've been meaning to send an \norganized group down there to kill that \nthing, but it would be dangerous. We \njust can't afford the chance of losing \nany men with all the trouble that's \ngoing on in the desert.\n",
 "A2Q1EarlyReturnGeglash": "65\nAh-hah! Back for a small shot of \ncourage... Believe me, it doesn't help \nfor long.\n \nDrinks, barkeep!\n",
 "A2Q1EarlyReturnElzix": "69\nIf you're going to fight that thing, use \nsome common sense. Be knowledgeable \nabout what harms the undead. Poison, \nfor instance, will have little effect.\n",
 "A2Q1EarlyReturnLysander": "64\nHuh? Peppermint? Oh, Radament! Yes, \nyes. Ooh, a foul creature...\n \nSome of my exploding potions should do \nquite nicely against him. They usually \nwork well against the undead.\n",
 "A2Q1EarlyReturnDrognan": "49\nI've just been reading something \ninteresting about this sort of undead. \nApparently, certain Horadric funereal \npriests altered the bodies of their dead \nmages with magical and surgical \ntechniques -- often replacing body \nparts with those of animals.\n \nThis was thought to augment their \npowers, and raise their status in the \nafterlife.\n",
 "A2Q1EarlyReturnFara": "68\nDrognan told me something interesting \nearlier today. It might explain why \nRadament is so restless, and it might \nhave something to do with why he is \nstealing human body parts.\n",
 "A2Q1EarlyReturnCain": "41\nThe Horadric mummies were created to \nprotect the tombs, but Radament is far \nfrom his burial chamber. Given the \naberrations that have been witnessed \nlately, it comes as no surprise that \neven the ancient guardian spells have \nbegun to unravel. Be wary of this as \nyou venture farther into the desert.\n",
 "A2Q1SuccessfulGreiz": "76\nYou've killed Radament, eh? That's quite \na nice piece of work! If you ever need a \njob as a mercenary, I'd be happy to \nsign ya' up.\n",
 "A2Q1SuccessfulDrognan": "52\nFrom what you tell me, it would seem \nthat Radament was bent on the task of \nreviving his own mummified corpse \nwith the flesh of the living.\n \nThis is very unusual indeed. It takes an \nincredible magic power to alter the \nsingular purpose of an undead mind.\n \nPerhaps there is a power at work here \nwhich is beyond my ken.\n",
 "A2Q1SuccessfulLysander": "61\nUh... Little of what I am able to hear is \nof any value. Radament's death, \nhowever, is news worth hearing. I'm \nsure Atma will be glad to hear of this.\n",
 "A2Q1SuccessfulMeshif": "62\nGood job mate! At night out on my ship, \nI was often awakened by that fiend's \nawful moaning. I bet I rest easier now.\n",
 "A2Q1SuccessfulGeglash": "41\nWhoah oh... 'Radament the Fallen', is it?\n \nI've fallen off many a barstool and no \none calls me 'Geglash the Fallen'. They \nmight go so far as to say, 'Geglash, \nyou've fallen!'\n",
 "A2Q1SuccessfulElzix": "70\nWe ran into one of those old tomb \nguardians when I ran with my bandits. \nI know they aren't easy foes to face, so \nyou sure have my respect. Have you \ntold Atma yet?\n",
 "A2Q1SuccessfulWarrivAct2": "142\nAtma's been telling everyone what \nyou've done for her.\n",
 "A2Q1SuccessfulFara": "102\nAs you have helped Atma and all of us, \nso shall I help you.\n",
 "A2Q1SuccessfulCain": "57\nIf you haven't already, tell Atma that \nRadament is dead. It may help to ease \nthe weight of her mourning.\n",
 "A2Q1SuccessfulAtma": "50\nThey say that the taste of vengeance is \nbittersweet, but I find it to my liking. \n \nIn addition to my undying gratitude, I \nhave spoken on your behalf with the \nrest of the townspeople. The \nmerchants have agreed to show their \ngratitude by offering their wares and \nservices at lower rates.\n \nOh... Jerhyn wants to see you, too. \nYou'll find him in front of the palace.\n",
 "A2Q2EarlyReturnScrollCain": "37\nAhh... The lost Horadric Scroll! What a \nfortunate turn of events...\n \nAs the last living Horadrim, I alone have \nknowledge of its meaning. Now, to read \nthe Horadric runes it bears. Hmmm...\n \nThe Horadric Mages, after binding Baal \nwithin Tal Rasha, magically sealed off \nhis Burial Chamber from the mortal \nrealm. Those same Mages also crafted \nfearsome Horadric Staves and imbued \nthem with the special power to open \nthe Chamber's hidden door.\n \nAfter nearly losing one to the thievery \nof a rogue sorcerer, they divided all \nthe Horadric Staves into two parts - \nwooden shaft and metal headpiece - \nhiding them separately to safeguard \nthem.\n \nThe Horadrim foresaw our current \nplight and designed the hiding places \nto reveal themselves to worthy heroes \nlike you.\n \nCollect both parts of a Horadric Staff \nand unite them using a Horadric Cube. \nThen, you may enter Tal Rasha's Burial \nChamber.\n",
 "A2Q2EarlyReturnCapCain": "50\nThe Viper Amulet you bear is actually \nthe headpiece of a Horadric Staff!\n \nYes... You have an uncanny knack for \nfinding rare and valuable artifacts. Of \ncourse, you'll have to use a Horadric \nCube to combine the headpiece with the \nshaft.\n",
 "A2Q2EarlyReturnStaveCain": "56\nThe Staff of Kings! You astound me, my \nfriend. You have discovered the shaft \nportion of a Horadric Staff.\n \nI trust you know how to use a Horadric \nCube to unite the shaft with its \nheadpiece.\n",
 "A2Q2EarlyReturnCubeCain": "40\nYou have quite a treasure there in that \nHoradric Cube. According to Horadric \nlore, the Cube can restore a Horadric \nStaff.\n \nTo do it - use the Cube as you would a \nscroll. When the Cube opens, place \nboth pieces of the Staff into it and use \nthe Cube's transmute power.\n \nYou'll be pleased to know that the Cube \nhas other alchemical uses as well...\n \nSix gems plus one sword transmute into \na socketed long sword.\n \nYou may also transmute two quivers of \ncrossbow bolts into one quiver of \narrows, while two quivers of arrows \nyield one quiver of bolts.\n \nI must leave it to you to discover other \nformulae.\n",
 "A2Q2SuccessfulStaffCain": "46\nExcellent! You have a Horadric Staff.\n \nCarry it with you into Tal Rasha's Tomb. \nFind within the Tomb the chamber \nwhose floor is inset with the Circle of \nSeven Symbols.\n \nPlace the Staff into the receptacle you \nfind there. That will open the secret \npassage into Tal Rasha's Burial \nChamber.\n \nBut, be prepared for a fight - you'll \nlikely have to kill Tal Rasha to destroy \nBaal.\n",
 "A2Q3AfterInitJerhyn": "110\nMy astrologers failed to predict this \neclipse. You should seek Drognan's \nadvice.\n",
 "A2Q3AfterInitGreiz": "71\nThis midday darkness reeks of foul \nmagic! My men and I are trying to keep \nthe peace, but this kind of thing really \nscares people.\n",
 "A2Q3AfterInitElzix": "65\nTwo men arrived late last night bearing \na story about evil magic. They said \nthey saw a gathering of giant snake \ncreatures performing some arcane \nritual. They sound like the Serpent Men \nof the desert.\n",
 "A2Q3AfterInitWarrivAct2": "72\nThe sun has grown disgusted with the \nterrible deeds it must shine upon each \nday. Damnation is upon us all.\n",
 "A2Q3AfterInitAtma": "121\nDrognan, the wizard, will have some \nidea as to what is happening.\n",
 "A2Q3AfterInitGeglash": "100\nThis whole place is one big ale fog.\n",
 "A2Q3AfterInitFara": "70\nThis unnatural nightfall is no doubt \ncaused by evil sorcery. Drognan might \nknow what we are dealing with.\n",
 "A2Q3AfterInitLysander": "65\nClaw Vipers! This outer darkness \nmirrors the inner blackness of their \nsouls. It is they who have eclipsed the \nsun, I'll wager. They are a venomous \nband.\n",
 "A2Q3AfterInitDrognan": "77\nI've been researching this lengthy \neclipse and I believe it to be the work \nof Claw Vipers.\n \nFind their temple beneath the desert \nsands and you may find the source of \nthis curse.\n",
 "A2Q3AfterInitMeshif": "76\nThis permanent darkness is very \nunsettling. Hmmm... It would make \nnavigation by stars easier for me, \nthough.\n",
 "A2Q3AfterInitCain": "62\nDrognan may have some advice on this \nmatter. Hmm... I think I'll speak with \nhim myself.\n",
 "A2Q3EarlyReturnJerhyn": "130\nThis eclipse is a definite manifestation \nof evil.\n",
 "A2Q3EarlyReturnGreiz": "73\nDon't worry! My men and I have an iron \ngrip on this town. If those cursed Claw \nVipers are plotting anything against \nus, we'll be prepared for 'em.\n",
 "A2Q3EarlyReturnWarrivAct2": "73\nThe calculated coldness of the reptilian \nbrain makes the Claw Vipers uncanny \nadversaries.\n",
 "A2Q3EarlyReturnGeglash": "49\nIt's strange when the morning after the \nnight before... is still the same night.\n",
 "A2Q3EarlyReturnMeshif": "105\nI've had about enough of this darkness. \nI don't even know what day it is \nanymore.\n",
 "A2Q3EarlyReturnFara": "77\nThe Claw Vipers practice evil magic. \nThey have also been known to kidnap \ntravelers and sacrifice them to their \ndark gods.\n",
 "A2Q3EarlyReturnLysander": "82\nWell... I don't know much about the \nhabits of Claw Vipers, to be honest. \nDrognan will probably know something \nabout the nature of the magic at work.\n",
 "A2Q3EarlyReturnDrognan": "51\nI've discovered a reference to a similar \neclipse several hundred years ago. It \nsays that some desert-dwelling snake \ndemons had erected an evil altar, \nwhich caused the sun to go black.\n \nPerhaps we are dealing with something \nsimilar here. Look for an altar in the \nClaw Viper temple.\n",
 "A2Q3EarlyReturnElzix": "94\nI usually charge for rooms by the night.\n \nBut I may have to soon change that.\n",
 "A2Q3EarlyReturnCain": "57\nThe source of this spell is probably a \nmagical altar. It will not be enough to \nkill the Claw Vipers. To reverse the \nspell you must destroy the altar.\n",
 "A2Q3EarlyReturnAtma": "80\nI was going to go to bed, but then I \nrealized that I have no idea what time \nit is. It could be the crack of dawn, for \nall I know.\n",

 "A2Q3SuccessfulGreiz": "219\nI'm glad that's over with!\n",
 "A2Q3SuccessfulElzix": "74\nAhh... It takes but one eye to revel in \nthe beauty of our restored sun.\n",
 "A2Q3SuccessfulGeglash": "60\nSo, this is daylight... It's over-rated.\n",
 "A2Q3SuccessfulWarrivAct2": "80\nWith renewed daylight, one may gather \nthe wits that were scattered about like \nrestrictive undergarments in the \ndarkness.\n",
 "A2Q3SuccessfulMeshif": "130\nSo... Did you plunder any booty?\n",
 "A2Q3SuccessfulAtma": "132\nYou have done well to restore light to \nour world.\n",
 "A2Q3SuccessfulFara": "87\nDrognan seems to have taken you into \nhis confidence. This is good, for you \nwill benefit from his wisdom.\n",
 "A2Q3SuccessfulLysander": "69\nAhhh... Claw Vipers are fond of magical \nartifacts. Did you happen to find one in \ntheir temple?\n",
 "A2Q3SuccessfulDrognan": "69\nYou did well in destroying the Claw \nVipers. We are all glad to see the sun \nreturned to its former glory.\n",
 "A2Q3SuccessfulCain": "48\nI've been speaking with Lord Jerhyn, and \nI sense that he is becoming more and \nmore agitated by something. You \nshould try to talk to him again.\n \nIf he still won't take you into his \nconfidence, seek to prove yourself a bit \nmore. I gather that his respect for you \nis growing.\n",
 "A2Q4InitDrognan": "41\nI've been researching the old records, \ntrying to find the location of Tal \nRasha's Tomb. Though I haven't found \nthe Tomb, itself, I may have a good \nlead for you.\n \nThe great Vizjerei Summoner, Horazon, \nbuilt his Arcane Sanctuary somewhere \naround here. He was a powerful \nspellcaster and kept demons as slaves \nwithin the Sanctuary. He kept a close \neye on great events, too -- such as the \nimprisonment of Baal within Tal \nRasha's Tomb.\n \nIf you could find Horazon's Sanctuary, \nI'm sure that it would hold some clue \nas to the Tomb's location. Though I \ndoubt Horazon is still alive, you must \nproceed with caution. There's no telling \nwhat could be waiting inside.\n \nWhen I spoke of this with Lord Jerhyn, \nhe asked that I send you to him. \nPerhaps he knows of a secret entrance \nor the like.\n",
 "A2Q4AfterInitFara": "46\nAh, the ancient mage Horazon! He \nbelieved that he could bend Evil forces \nto his will. What he didn't know was \nthat Evil uses man, not the reverse.\n \nThe Vizjerei still revere him as a symbol \nof man's ability to triumph over other \nworldly forces. The Church of Light, \nhowever, cites him as an example of \nman's folly.\n",
 "A2Q4AfterInitGreiz": "89\nThe only thing in Jerhyn's cellar are the \nharem girls that have been hiding there \nsince the troubles began.\n",
 "A2Q4AfterInitElzix": "62\nAn 'Arcane Sanctuary' under the \npalace? I'd heard that there were some \nunderground cellar levels that Jerhyn \nused as chambers for his treasure and \nsuch, but no Arcane Sanctuary.\n",
 "A2Q4AfterInitJerhyn": "44\nWhen the troubles began here, I allowed \nthe terrified Harem guilds to join me \nwithin the safety of the palace. All was \nfine, until one night...\n \nScreams echoed up the stairwells from \nthe harem. My guards arrived to find \nthe poor girls being slaughtered by a \nmerciless band of hell-spawned \ndemons. My brave guardsmen tried to \npush the demons back into the \nmysterious rift from which they came.\n \nEver since, my men have fought a losing \nbattle. Demons have continued to pour \nthrough the rift into the palace. \nUltimately, I hired Greiz and his \nmercenaries to help protect the rest of \nmy fair city.\n \nDrognan believes that the Arcane \nSanctuary lies buried underneath this \npalace, since Lut Gholein occupies the \nsite of an ancient Vizjerei fortress.\n \nMy palace is open to you now... Take \ncare.\n",
 "A2Q4AfterInitCain": "45\nI very much doubt that Horazon still \nlives in his Sanctuary. He possessed \ngreat power and influence over \ndemons, but even that may not have \nbeen enough in the end. One of his \nnotoriety cannot easily remove himself \nfrom the vengeful reach of Hell.\n",
 "A2Q4AfterInitGeglash": "60\nLook, look... I'm just about as tough and \narrogant as they come, but you'd never \ncatch me trying to tame a demon for a \npet. That's just asking for a lot of \ntrouble.\n",
 "A2Q4AfterInitAtma": "75\nArcane Sanctuary? That place sounds \nawful! Even if you find a way into it, \nwhat makes you think you'll be able to \nleave again?\n",
 "A2Q4AfterInitWarrivAct2": "73\nA careful caravan gives wide berth to \nsleeping bandits. If Horazon is gone, \nlet him remain so.\n",
 "A2Q4AfterInitLysander": "49\nHorazon found it necessary to lock \nhimself up for all time, just to protect \nhimself from those angry demons. \nSuch is the fate of one who practices \nthe summoning arts... that, or eternal \ndamnation. There's old summoners and \nbold summoners, but no old, bold \nsummoners.\n",
 "A2Q4AfterInitDrognan": "42\nNearly a thousand years ago, Horazon \nrose to the fore of the Vizjerei mage \nclan. Horazon used the knowledge of \nthe Vizjerei to summon and control \ndemons from Hell.\n \nThough a powerful Summoner, Horazon \nfeared that the Lords of Hell would \npunish him for enslaving their \nbrethren. Thus, the Summoner created \nfor himself an Arcane Sanctuary.\n \nHe believed that his Sanctuary would \nnot only protect him from Hell's \nvengeance, but also allow him to \ncontinue his studies free from the \nravages of time and disease.\n \nHorazon had crafted many wondrous \nscrying devices through which he \nobserved the events of the world \noutside. It is certain that he took \ncareful study of Tal Rasha's \nimprisonment and recorded the \nlocation of his forgotten Tomb.\n \nThe Arcane Sanctuary was believed to \nhave been constructed here in Lut \nGholein. An entrance may be hidden \nsomewhere in the palace, as that \nbuilding is very old, and was once a \nVizjerei fortress.\n",
 "A2Q4AfterInitMeshif": "57\nAhh... The legend of Horazon is an old \none, especially around these parts. You \nwouldn't believe the feats and strange \nevents that are attributed to him.\n",
 "A2Q4EarlyReturnElzix": "63\nI understand that you've been talking to \nJerhyn. Well, if so, then you're the first \nin a long while... since the trouble \nbegan, actually.\n \nDo us a favor and try to find out what's \ngot Jerhyn so edgy all the time. OK?\n",
 "A2Q4EarlyReturnJerhyn": "48\nThere was an eastern mage... a Vizjerei, \nI believe... who visited me almost a \nyear ago. He was very interested in the \nhistory of this site, and he seemed \nparticularly fascinated with the palace \narchitecture.\n \nI gave him a tour. When he found the \nancient seals over a passageway in the \ncellar, he became very agitated. He \nasked for some time alone to study \nthem, and I granted it.\n \nShortly after, he left with no further \nword and I never saw him again. Odd... \nDon't you think?\n",
 "A2Q4EarlyReturnGreiz": "61\nWhat's got you so occupied in the \npalace? Don't tell me you're finding the \nHarems more compelling than killing \ndemons? That would be out of \ncharacter for one such as yourself.\n",
 "A2Q4EarlyReturnDrognan": "63\nI am certain that you will find the \ninformation you need when you find \nHorazon's Journal. I suggest you find it \nquickly, for Diablo may be getting \ncloser to freeing his brother as we \nspeak.\n",
 "A2Q4EarlyReturnLysander": "68\nHuh? The horizon is always out of \nreach, you should know that. Oh, \nHorazon! Oh, I see. Uh.\n \nYes. Well. He was insane. Brilliant, yes, \nbut... total lunatic.\n",
 "A2Q4EarlyReturnFara": "57\nEven a sanctuary such as Horazon's \ncan be breached by the tentacles of \nEvil. Such a haven could have become a \nchamber of unspeakable horrors. Be \nwary of what you may unleash!\n",
 "A2Q4EarlyReturnGeglash": "49\nAll my years of brawling, of pummeling \nboth the unsuspecting and the \ndeserving, have yielded two insights. \nYou can either fight or you can run. All \nother strategies are variations of \nthese.\n",
 "A2Q4EarlyReturnMeshif": "77\nSo... Now that you're such a pal of \nJerhyn, why don't you ask him if I can \nset sail one of these days? I'm running \nout of patience.\n",
 "A2Q4EarlyReturnAtma": "87\nSo you've been in the palace, have you? \nTell me, why does Jerhyn keep that \nplace locked up so tight?\n",
 "A2Q4EarlyReturnWarrivAct2": "87\nFate is like a caged gorilla. It will pelt \nyou with dung if you mock it.\n",
 "A2Q4EarlyReturnCain": "51\nI've been thinking about the problems in \nJerhyn's palace. Perhaps this has \noccurred to you as well...\n \nIf those cellar passageways lead to the \nArcane Sanctuary, then that is where \nthe demons came from. Horazon's \nhaven must have been breached!\n",
 "A2Q4SuccessfulNarrator": "37\nSeekers of the Tomb of Tal Rasha will \nfind it through the Portal. But know \nthat the glowing glyphs recorded here \nin my Arcane Sanctuary are the signs \nof the six False Tombs.\n \nThe missing Seventh Sign marks the \nTomb of Tal Rasha... Of the Horadrim \nhe might be called the foremost.\n \nIt was a shining - but brief - moment for \nthe Mage Clans when they set aside \ntheir differences and worked together \nagainst the common enemy.\n \nThe Horadrim relentlessly pursued the \nThree across the desolate Empires of \nthe East, and even into the uncharted \nlands of the West, leaving the \nArchangel Tyrael's hands unblemished.\n \nPresuming the Three to be vanquished, \nthe Horadrim's unstable fellowship \nbegan to dissipate. Abandoning their \nsacred charge to safeguard the three \nSoulstones, the disparate Mage Clans \nbegan to squabble amongst each other \nover petty differences.\n \nTheir conflicts not only dissolved their \nbrotherhood, but strengthened the \nEvils which they had buried beneath the \ncold earth.\n",
 "A2Q4SuccessfulGriez": "59\nUnbelievable! The Harem girls are dead! \nThe palace guards have been fighting \noff demons from the cellar. How could \nthat happen without my knowledge?\n",
 "A2Q4SuccessfulJerhyn": "62\nI thank you for your heroic aid! I'm also \nglad that you found something you \nwere looking for. The journal should \nhelp you find the True Tomb of Tal \nRasha. Hopefully, there is still time to \nget there before Diablo.\n \nGo now. And good luck.\n",
 "A2Q4SuccessfulDrognan": "55\nYou have found Horazon's Journal. \nExcellent... But, I must caution you.\n \nThe mark of the True Tomb of Tal \nRasha, is sought, if not already known, \nby Diablo. I needn't elaborate on the \nimplications of that.\n",
 "A2Q4SuccessfulElzix": "71\nNews of the tragedy in the palace is \nspreading fast. How awful! And to \nthink, this whole time I thought Jerhyn \nand his guards were in there playing \nwith the harem girls.\n",
 "A2Q4SuccessfulGeglash": "60\nHah! I wish Jerhyn would've let me in the \npalace. I would've saved those girls and \nkicked demon ass back to the fire-pits \no' Hell!\n",
 "A2Q4SuccessfulMeshif": "52\nSo... Now we know Jerhyn's little secret. \nWell... I guess I can see why he wanted \nme to stay, though... I'm just glad it \ndidn't come to that. Now he tells me to \nwait some more, in case you need to \nget out of here.\n \nWell, for you I'll do it. Maybe they'll \nmention me in the epic ballads, eh?\n",
 "A2Q4SuccessfulWarrivAct2": "67\nWell, the news going around town is \nvery unsettling. Apparently, we were in \nmore danger than anyone thought.\n \nGood work friend... you may have saved \nall our skins.\n",
 "A2Q4SuccessfulFara": "64\nFaith is stronger than any armor. The \nshield will protect the body, but Faith \nwill strengthen the courageous heart.\n",
 "A2Q4SuccessfulLysander": "55\nHorazon's urinal? Oh, journal! Yes, \nwell... Glad you found it. Such a shame \nabout those poor harem girls, huh? I \nshall miss them deeply... I mean their \nconversations, of course.\n",
 "A2Q4SuccessfulAtma": "62\nOh, those poor women! Will the \nslaughter never end? Thank you once \nagain for protecting our city.\n",
 "A2Q4SuccessfulCain": "57\nYou must move quickly now, friend, for \nDiablo is undoubtedly close to finding \nwhat he seeks. Find the Tomb of Tal \nRasha before he frees the Lord of \nDestruction.\n",
 "A2Q5EarlyReturnGreiz": "89\nThat guy really talks like that? Sounds \nlike either Horazon has gone stir-crazy \nor that's some impostor.\n",
 "A2Q5EarlyReturnJerhyn": "57\nThe man you describe is probably not \nHorazon.\n \nHe sounds like the very mage who came \naround here a while ago. He was very \ncurious about this palace and seemed \nespecially interested in the seal on the \npassageway in the cellar. He left \nshortly after that. I wonder how he got \ndown there? The seal was never \nbroken...\n \nThat mage spoke a great deal to \nDrognan. Why don't you ask him about \nit?\n",
 "A2Q5EarlyReturnDrognan": "47\nYes... The man you speak of sounds like \nthe mage who came here many months \nago. He claimed to have fought Diablo \nin the passages beneath Tristram.\n \nNo doubt the fool wandered into \nHorazon's Sanctuary and lost whatever \nwas left of his ravaged mind. He is \nbeyond salvation. \n \nIt is possible that the fool has been \npossessed by the spirit of Horazon. If \nthat's true, then you'd better put an \nend to his tortured existence.\n \nOnce done, I believe the demons who \nwere summoned and imprisoned within \nthe Sanctuary will cease to exist as \nwell.\n",
 "A2Q5EarlyReturnLysander": "57\nAh, yes. I remember. There was a... \nfellow around here many months ago \nwho asked almost as many questions \nabout Horazon as you.\n \nSo... He discovered enough to assume \nHorazon's place in the Arcane \nSanctuary, huh? What a fool!\n",
 "A2Q5EarlyReturnMeshif": "72\nAh, yes. As a ship captain I am well \naware of the phenomenon of a false \nHorazon.\n \nSorry, just a little joke.\n",
 "A2Q5EarlyReturnWarrivAct2": "99\nThere's nothing more dreadful than a \npowerful being driven by a frayed \nmind.\n",
 "A2Q5EarlyReturnAtma": "105\nYou always seem to find the worst \ntrouble. I don't know how you handle it.\n",
 "A2Q5EarlyReturnGeglash": "38\nSo! Horazon's crazy, eh? I'd be \nsurprised if he wasn't. All those \ncenturies without ale would drive \nanyone to drink... but then you couldn't \ndrink. And that would drive you to \ndrink... Hah?... What was the question?\n",
 "A2Q5EarlyReturnFara": "63\nHmmm... That doesn't sound like \nHorazon. I'll agree that he may have \ngone mad, but from what you tell me, I \ndon't think that's the case. Talk to \nDrognan... he may know more than I.\n",
 "A2Q5EarlyReturnElzix": "106\nUgh... Crazy mages give me the creeps.\n \nJust kill him and get on with your \nbusiness.\n",
 "A2Q5EarlyReturnCain": "45\nThe appearance of the mage you \ndescribe sounds like one I met back in \nTristram. Many Vizjerei came to fight \nagainst Diablo, the Lord of Terror. \nPerhaps, this is one of them.\n \nYou know, fate seems to have frowned \nupon all of the heroes who confronted \nthat terrible Evil. Take care or the \nsame may happen to you.\n",
 "A2Q5SuccessfulGreiz": "76\nSo, Horazon's been dead for some time. \nI take it you at least found what you \nwere looking for.\n",
 "A2Q5SuccessfulGeglash": "60\nThe way I see it... Well, it's all pretty \nblurry.\n",
 "A2Q5SuccessfulJerhyn": "63\nThe demonic force that was emanating \nfrom the corrupted Sanctuary has \ndissipated. I thank you greatly for your \nhelp. Now, we can look to rebuilding \nour lives.\n \nAll will be for nothing, though, if you do \nnot stop the greater Evil which is \nrapidly gaining ground.\n",
 "A2Q5SuccessfulDrognan": "83\nLarger forces are moving inexorably \ntowards us. You must now make haste \nto the Tombs.\n",
 "A2Q5SuccessfulElzix": "65\nYou make me long for the days of glory. \nWhen I had both hands, both eyes and \nmore of a foot...\n",
 "A2Q5SuccessfulWarrivAct2": "84\nI guess you'll be heading to the Tombs \nnow? I hear that they're in the deepest \ndesert regions.\n",
 "A2Q5SuccessfulMeshif": "100\nWell! You've got what you're after. Now \nget a move on before it's too late.\n",
 "A2Q5SuccessfulLysander": "103\nHuhhh... Such is always the fate of \nthose who meddle with evil.\n",
 "A2Q5SuccessfulAtma": "89\nYou're more the hero than I could have \ndreamed. Perhaps, there is hope for us \nafter all.\n",
 "A2Q5SuccessfulFara": "74\nI feel no pity for that would-be \nSummoner. His terrible ambition for \ndemonic power was his undoing. You \nmerely hastened the inevitable.\n",
 "A2Q5SuccessfulCain": "48\nI hope that this false Summoner found \npeace in death. Unfortunately, it is \nmore likely that he will be dragged \ndown into Hell by the demons he was \nbound to.\n \nLet this be a lesson to you... Demonic \nmagic is a quick path, but its powers \nare seductive and deadly.\n",
 "A2Q6InitJerhyn": "45\nI have heard of your many deeds of skill \nand bravery. I feel I can trust you with \nsomething I have been hesitant to \nspeak of...\n \nDrognan and I have concluded that the \nDark Wanderer who passed through \nhere recently was Diablo, himself! \nDrognan believes that Diablo is \nsearching the desert for the secret \ntomb where the great Horadric mage, \nTal Rasha, keeps Baal imprisoned.\n \nYou must find Diablo and put an end to \nthe terrible evil that has fallen upon \nour city. Drognan is wise and is sure to \nhave some helpful advice for you as to \nhow Tal Rasha's tomb may be found.\n \nIt may take you quite some time to find \nThe Tomb. May you be ready when you \ndo.\n",
 "A2Q6AfterInitJerhyn": "53\nIt is well-known that there are seven \ngreat Horadric tombs hidden beneath \nthe sands in the furthest reaches of \nthe desert. One of them surely must be \nTal Rasha's prison. You must explore \neach of the tombs to find Tal Rasha's \nexact location.\n \nOf course, Diablo is searching for the \nTomb as well... No one can guess as to \nwhat terrors he has unleashed in his \nsearch.\n",
 "A2Q6AfterInitElzix": "59\nSo... You're going to search for the \nSeven Tombs, huh? Don't you know \nthat they're just desert legends passed \nbetween merchants and travelers? No \none really believes that they exist.\n",
 "A2Q6AfterInitWarrivAct2": "61\nBe very careful, my friend. I think I've \nseen enough recently not to doubt that \nthese Tombs exist. And if they do, \nthey're most certainly guarded by \nterrible creatures.\n",
 "A2Q6AfterInitAtma": "67\nI've heard legends of the Tomb of Tal \nRasha, but I thought they were just old \ntales meant to scare young children.\n",
 "A2Q6AfterInitGeglash": "59\nOhh... I'd go with ya' to those tombs... \nBut... umm... I don't like all that living \ndead stuff.\n",
 "A2Q6AfterInitMeshif": "84\nI'm sorry, I can't help you much here. \nNow, if the tombs were across the \nocean, then I'd be the guy to talk to.\n",
 "A2Q6AfterInitFara": "57\nLegend has it that Tal Rasha lies \nimprisoned within his tomb, forever \nstruggling to keep the Lord of \nDestruction bound. His was a selfless \nact, although perhaps foolhardy.\n",
 "A2Q6AfterInitLysander": "56\nWhen Tal Rasha chose to embody the \nspirit of Baal, he knew his doom was to \nwrestle eternally against the will of the \ngreater Evil. Look around you and ask \nyourself, 'Has the battle been won or \nlost?'\n",
 "A2Q6AfterInitDrognan": "55\nTal Rasha's tomb is hidden deep in the \ndesert among six others. Tal Rasha's \nsymbol marks the True Tomb. If you \nwant to know what that symbol is, you \nshould be able to find it within the \nlegendary Arcane Sanctuary.\n",
 "A2Q6AfterInitCain": "57\nDiablo nears his goal. We have little \ntime to lose.\n \nRemember, my friend, that Andariel \ngave herself willingly to Diablo's cause. \nIt would be prudent to assume that the \nother Evils will attempt to aid their \nmaster as well.\n",
 "A2Q6AfterInitGreiz": "106\nIf you're going into the deep desert, why \nnot hire a few of my men to watch your \nback?\n",
 "A2Q6SuccessfulJerhyn": "47\nYou have done very well. Few could have \ncome this far, let alone discover the \nTrue Tomb of Tal Rasha. Unfortunately, \nI hear that Diablo and Baal have eluded \nyour grasp. This is most unfortunate...\n \nIf you wish to travel East, I have \nauthorized Meshif to give you passage \nby sea. I imagine he should be very \nanxious to leave by now.\n \nGood luck on your quest, and thank you \nagain for saving my beloved city. You \nwill always be welcome in Lut Gholein, \nmy friend.\n",
 "A2Q6SuccessfulElzix": "71\nI heard that Diablo has managed to \nbest you, at least for the time being. I \nhope you catch up with him soon, and \nsend him back to Hell for good!\n",
 "A2Q6SuccessfulLysander": "70\nI'm sorry things didn't turn out as you \nhad hoped. Go and remember us \nfondly. You know, you bothered me far \nless than most.\n",
 "A2Q6SuccessfulAtma": "64\nYou have proven to be the greatest of \nheroes, and I am honored to call you \nfriend. Thank you for bringing peace to \nour lives again.\n",
 "A2Q6SuccessfulWarrivAct2": "68\nNever fear, my friend. You did the best \nyou could.\n \nI suspect that Diablo and Baal are now \nheading east, towards Kurast. You'll \nfind them... I know you will.\n",
 "A2Q6SuccessfulFara": "46\nThis is terrible news! Baal is in \npossession of one of mankind's most \npowerful mages, and the Lord of Terror \nguides his path. They must be stopped, \nfor I am sure they mean to free their \nelder brother Mephisto, the Lord of \nHatred, who lies imprisoned under the \ncorrupted city of Kurast.\n \nI fear you are walking into a great evil, \nbut your faith can save you. May you \nwalk in the light always.\n",
 "A2Q6SuccessfulGeglash": "54\nYou're an inspiration! And such a hero \nthat it makes me look twice as bad...\n \nAhh, you're OK... Hey! Just save some \nglory for us little guys, huh?\n",
 "A2Q6SuccessfulDrognan": "51\nThis is a serious setback... It is most \nunfortunate that Tal Rasha has been \nconsumed by Baal's destructive \ninfluence. There are many secrets \nknown to the Horadrim, which could be \nused by Baal against us.\n \nYou must travel east by sea to Kurast \nand stop Diablo and Baal before they \nfree their eldest brother, Mephisto.\n \nHahh... The lands of the eastern Empire \nare not the same as they used to be. \nThere has been little word for some \ntime.\n \nSpeed is of the essence. Go quickly, my \nfriend. May the fates smile on you.\n",
 "A2Q6SuccessfulMeshif": "82\nJerhyn tells me I should take you east to \nKurast. I haven't been there for several \nyears, but rumor has it that things are \npretty grim.\n",
 "A2Q6SuccessfulGreiz": "51\nI've heard that your foe got away from \nyou this time. Well, look at it this way... \nyou've got the demons on the run. If \nyou're going to be leaving, then... Well, \nthanks for your help.\n",
 "A2Q6SuccessfulCain": "39\nThe Archangel Tyrael was the one who \ngave the Soulstones to the Horadrim \ntwo hundred and sixty years ago.\n \nIt is highly unusual for the forces of \nHeaven to so directly interfere with \nman's destiny, but Tyrael was said to \nact of his own volition. We have never \nbeen able to discern why.\n \nPerhaps, he goes against the consensus \nof Heaven because he doubts our \nability to defend ourselves, or perhaps, \nhe sees more threat than his peers.\n \nWhere the actions of Hell often seem \nstraightforwardly bent on destruction, \nthe motives of Heaven are \nunfathomable.\n \nNow make haste... Both Diablo and Baal \nmust be stopped before they join with \ntheir brother, Mephisto. If the three \nPrime Evils unite once again, the world \nas we know it will be no more.\n",
 "NatalyaIntroGossip1": "48\nGreetings, hero. I've heard of your \nexploits and... I'm quite impressed. \nVery few mortals are capable of \ndealing with the Three and their \nminions as you have.\n \nMy name is Natalya. I am a hunter of \nEvil, part of an ancient Order sworn to \nhunt down corrupted sorcerers.\n \nIf I could, I would gladly join your quest \nto stop the Three. But I must wait here \nfor further news. I can't predict what \nwill happen, but the danger is greater \nthan we can know.\n \nUntil I receive my orders, I'll assist you \nwith the information I have.\n",
 "NatalyaGossip1": "74\nAsheara...? Oh, she's is a tough-talking \nmage, but I'd wager she's never faced \ntrue Evil.\n \nPampering drunken mercenaries is one \nthing, but standing face to face with a \nhell-spawned demon is another.\n",
 "NatalyaGossip2": "69\nI've heard the name of Deckard Cain \nmany times. He's the last of the \nHoradrim, and thus, I must honor him. \nYou must be powerful, indeed, if one \nsuch as he accompanies you.\n",
 "NatalyaGossip3": "100\nHratli is a master craftsman. My Order \ncould make use of one with his unique \nskills.\n",
 "NatalyaGossip4": "67\nMy Order has been keeping watch over \nOrmus for many years, now. He seems \nto champion the cause of good, but \nwho knows what shadow lurks within \nhis soul?\n",
 "CainAct3IntroGossip1": "45\nI've not set foot in glorious Kurast for \nmany years. But I never would have \nimagined it could be so corrupted.\n \nCertainly, this must be Mephisto's work! \nYou'd best get going, my friend. Diablo \nand Baal are still out there and you \nmust find them.\n",
 "CainAct3Gossip1": "62\nSeeing his homeland in such a state \nmust be horrifying to Meshif. I'm \nsurprised he's willing to remain here in \norder to help you.\n",
 "CainAct3Gossip2": "82\nAsheara seems like a very tough \nwoman. I'd be careful around her if I \nwere you.\n",
 "CainAct3Gossip3": "53\nDrognan told me of Hratli when we were \nin Lut Gholein. He said that he weaves \nmagic into his forge and produces \nmystical weapons and armor.\n \nHis skills could be quite useful to you. \n",
 "CainAct3Gossip4": "44\nJudging from his dress and strange \nmarkings, I would guess that Ormus is \nfrom the ancient Taan mage-clan. Yet \nnone of the others here seem to know \nthat he is a sorcerer.\n \nThe Taan were once as powerful as the \nVizjerei clan, but their studies were \neven more secretive. I wonder what \nhe's hiding.\n",

The only way to gain \nentry to Mephisto's prison is to destroy \nthe artifact known as the Compelling \nOrb.\n \nMephisto used this device to control the \nZakarum Priests and their followers. \nThe Orb can only be destroyed with an \nancient flail imbued with the spirit of \nthe one incorruptible priest.\n \nSoon after his imprisonment, Mephisto \nworked his evil corruption on the \nZakarum priesthood. All were turned to \nhis dark ways, save one - Khalim, the \nQue-Hegan of the High Council.\n \nMephisto directed the other Council \npriests to slay and dismember Khalim \nand then scatter his remains across \nthe Kingdom. The Priest Sankekur \nsucceeded Khalim as Que-Hegan, \neventually becoming the embodiment of \nMephisto here on the mortal plane.\n \nThe corrupted High Council fashioned \nan Orb to control the rest of the \nZakarum faithful and used their powers \nto hide the lair of their master from \nmortals.\n \nYour task is to collect the scattered \nrelics of Khalim - his Heart, his Brain, \nand his Eye. Then, using the Horadric \nCube, transmute Khalim's Flail with his \nrelics.\n \nOnce this is accomplished, you must \ndestroy the Compelling Orb with \nKhalim's Will to open the way into the \ncorrupt sanctum of Mephisto.\n",

 "A3Q2EarlyReturnEyeCain": "52\nAhh... Khalim's Eye! Only it can reveal \nthe true path to Mephisto.\n \nPlace the Eye in the Horadric Cube \nalong with Khalim's other relics - the \nHeart, the Brain, and the Flail.\n",
 "A3Q2EarlyReturnBrainCain": "58\nThis is most fortunate! Khalim's Brain \nknows Mephisto's weakness.\n \nPlace it in the Horadric Cube along with \nKhalim's other relics - the Eye, the \nHeart, and the Flail.\n",

You have \naccomplished the impossible!\n \nDiablo and Mephisto have been \nbanished back into the Black Abyss \nthat spawned them, and the corrupted \nSoulstones are no more.\n \nHowever, while you were fighting here, \nBaal remained behind in the mortal \nrealm, building an army of hellish \nminions. Now, Baal's army is searching \nfor the Worldstone, the ancient source \nof all the Soulstones and their power, \nwhile leaving behind a wake of \ndestruction. They have forged deeply \ninto the Barbarian homelands, heading \ndirectly for the summit of Mount \nArreat!\n \nBaal knows, mortal hero! That is the \nvery site of the blessed Worldstone!\n \nNow, enter the portal I have opened for \nyou. It will take you to the Barbarian \ncity of Harrogath, the last bastion of \nOrder on the slopes of Arreat.\n",
 "A4Q2ExpansionSuccessCain": "40\nI knew there was great potential in you, \nmy friend. You've done a fantastic job.\n \nThough my ancestors often struggled \nagainst the Three Evils and their \nminions, I've always lived a shut-in, \nscholarly life. I'm glad that my wisdom \naided you.\n \nNow, I wish to leave this place. Though \nHeaven's Gates are a marvel to behold, \nI hope I won't have to see them again \nfor many, many years.\n \nPlease talk to Tyrael about leaving this \nplace now!\n",
 "AncientsAct5IntroGossip1": "35\nWe are the spirits of the Nephalem, the \nAncient Ones. We have been chosen to \nguard sacred Mount Arreat, wherein \nthe Worldstone rests. Few are worthy \nto stand in its presence; fewer still can \ncomprehend its true purpose.\n \nBefore you enter, you must defeat us.\n",
 "CainAct5IntroGossip1": "39\nI am amazed to find this place so \nuntouched. Everything else in the path \nof Baal the Lord of Destruction lies in \nruin. \n \nThese Barbarians must indeed be the \nlegendary guardians of Mount Arreat. \nThey are a proud, hardy people. Don't \nexpect to be greeted warmly -- \nstrangers here rarely are.\n \nPerhaps I can gain their trust. I'll spend \nsome time with the townsfolk and try \nto understand them better. I'll let you \nknow what I discover.\n",
 "CainAct5Gossip1": "52\nWith hellspawn, size is no measure of \ntheir threat. Demons half the size of \nmen can kill with a gesture, while \nhellish pack animals trample any who \nstand in their way.\n",
 "CainAct5Gossip2": "55\nThough these Barbarians are known \nthroughout the kingdoms as ferocious \nfighters, they are also capable of great \ncompassion.\n \nThey have trained throughout history \nfor a battle their legends foretell will \ndecide the fate of the world.\n",
 "CainAct5Gossip3": "55\nThe angel Tyrael has watched over the \nguardians of Arreat throughout \nhistory. I do not believe that Baal and \nTyrael have come to fight over a paltry \nfew souls.\n \nThey are here to settle a conflict as old \nas time itself.\n",
 "CainAct5Gossip4": "44\nDuring my time with the Horadrim, we \noften debated the nature of Mount \nArreat.\n \nWe knew that the Barbarian clans \nzealously guarded the mountain as \ntheir sacred duty. However, many \ndismissed their zeal as simple \nsuperstition...combined with an inborn \nhostility toward outsiders.\n \nThose Horadrim who trekked up Arreat \nwere never heard from again...Still, I \ndo not believe they died at the hands of \nBarbarians.\n",
 "CainAct5Gossip5": "41\nAll users of the magical arts know of \nMount Arreat, but few understand its \ntrue nature. It is the nexus of an \nunfathomable magic.\n \nIt bodes ill that the Lord of Destruction \nraces to its summit with such purpose. \nI fear for the whole world should Baal \ngain what he seeks.\n",
 "CainAct5Gossip6": "59\nI have spent decades trying to \nunderstand the forces at work in this \nworld. But in the face of all that is \ntranspiring, I realize how meager my \nknowledge is.\n \nI will be of assistance where I can, my \nfriend.\n",

I hope \nyou can bring an end to Baal's reign of \ndestruction. \n \nOur Council of Elders is gone -- my \nfather, Aust, among them. The one \nthing that keeps us from total despair \nis the promise of vengeance against \nBaal.\n",
 "AnyaGossip1": "45\nNow that the Elders are all dead, I don't \nknow who will guide our people through \nthis dark time. I was to be next in line \nafter my father, but this burden is too \ngreat for me to shoulder alone. \n \nWe are a people of strong blood. I shall \ndo what I can and let fate do the rest.\n",
 "AnyaGossip2": "82\nBaal's minions are not to be trifled with. \nIn their bloodlust they will sacrifice \nthemselves to destroy you.\n",
 "AnyaGossip3": "60\nMany outsiders believe that the \nfantastic stories about our ancestors, \nthe Ancients, are but fables. However, I \nbelieve that the Ancients were more \nthan human -- that mankind has fallen \nfrom what it once was.\n",
 "AnyaGossip4": "58\nWhen I was a child, the Elders told us \nstories about the mountain and its \npower...and how the Barbarian people \nare bound to it as protectors.\n \nBaal is not just taking our land -- with \nevery step he takes up the mountain, \nhe takes a part of who we are as a \npeople.\n",
 "AnyaGossip5": "72\nI am truly glad you are here, warrior. \nPerhaps things would be different now \nif we had asked for assistance from \nthe neighboring kingdoms.\n \nOur foolish, foolish pride...\n",
 "AnyaGossip6": "54\nMy father, Aust, was among those \nElders wise enough to see that we \nwould need outside help to deal with \nBaal's legions. He believed that this \nconflict would affect the entire world, \nnot just our homeland. He said that \nMount Arreat is as necessary to the \nworld's survival as food and water is to \nour own.\n \nI believe this to be true.\n",
 "AnyaGossip7": "50\nQual-Kehk's confidence in his abilities \nonce bordered on arrogance, but in the \nearly days of the siege, he was \nhumbled by Baal. While he saved us \nfrom immediate destruction, a third of \nour warriors were lost.\n \nNone felt those losses more than he. \nThough he may not admit it, your \npresence gives him hope, warrior.\n",
 "AnyaGossip8": "78\nIf Larzuk could sing or dance half as \nwell as he smiths, he'd be married by \nnow.\n \n...Just look at those shoulders.\n",
 "AnyaGossip9": "57\nNihlathak was the last of our Elders, \nwhose charge it was to safeguard the \nmountain. He alone tried to guide us \nthrough the most desperate time in our \nhistory -- but he was just as helpless as \nthe rest of us.\n \nI cannot forgive his betrayal, but I can \nlearn from it.\n",
 "AnyaGossip10": "60\nOur people believe that the Ancients \nprotecting Mount Arreat have the \npower to stop Baal. Unfortunately, the \nLord of Destruction has shown great \npower to undermine our faith.\n",
 "LarzukAct5IntroGossip1": "55\nI am Larzuk, the armorer. My ancestors \nwere some of the finest craftsmen in \nHarrogath. \n \nRegretfully, my supplies run lower with \nevery passing day, yet the demons \nbeyond the walls have not weakened. \n \nI fear the time is near when I must put \ndown my hammer and take up a sword, \ninstead.\n",

She had \ndecided to go rescue them. \n \nI told her that her quest was a foolish \none and that she would be safer \nstaying within the city walls. However, \nshe is a willful girl and would not listen \nto me. \n \nThe next morning, she was gone. No \none is more distraught than I over \nlosing her. \n \nHowever, if you feel the need to be \nMalah's errand child, I won't try to stop \nyou.\n",
 "A5Q3AfterInitQualKehk": "43\nAnya's father, Aust, was our wisest \nElder. He was killed along with the \nother Elders who erected the ward that \nprotects this city. The ward has kept \nBaal's demons out of Harrogath, but at \na costly sacrifice. \n \nNihlathak, on the other hand, was the \nonly Elder to escape the demons. \nSomehow, he alone managed to find \nsanctuary, while the others died \naround him.\n \nEver since that day, Nihlathak and Anya \nhave been at odds.\n",
 "A5Q3EarlyReturnMalah": "52\nIf it were anyone else, I would assume \nher dead. However, Anya is not so \neasily beaten. I know she must be alive.\n",
 "A5Q3EarlyReturnCain": "60\nNihlathak's story does sound \nreasonable, considering what I've \nheard about Anya. However, the best \nlies are often hidden within truth.\n",
 "A5Q3EarlyReturnLarzuk": "56\nAs the daughter of Elder Aust, Anya is \nthe only person, besides Nihlathak, \nwho has any real knowledge of Mount \nArreat's secrets. I'd hate to see our \nfate in the hands of Nihlathak alone.\n",
 "A5Q3EarlyReturnNihlathak": "46\nLook, I've told you! She's dead! If you \nknew what was good for you, you'd \nconcentrate your efforts on saving \nHarrogath -- not on lost causes like \nAnya.\n",
 "A5Q3EarlyReturnQualKehk": "81\nIt seems like everyone feels Nihlathak \nplayed a part in Anya's disappearance.\n \nWhy would he do such a thing?\n",
 "A5Q3FoundAnyaMalah": "56\nSo! That snake Nihlathak was behind \nAnya's disappearance...and he trapped \nher with a freezing curse.\n \nHere. Take this potion to Anya and give \nit to her. That should release her.\n",
 "A5Q3FoundAnyaCain": "54\nGoodness! Anya frozen by that fallen \nBarbarian, Nihlathak...Perhaps Malah \ncan help you where I cannot.\n",
 "A5Q3FoundAnyaLarzuk": "80\nPoor Anya! I should've known Nihlathak \nwas a traitor...\n \nIf you find him alive, kill him for me!\n",
 "A5Q3FoundAnyaQualKehk": "70\nThe snake has slipped our grasp! While \nyou were gone, Nihlathak disappeared.\n \nI'll bet Anya knows how to track him \ndown.\n",
 "A5Q3FoundAnyaAnya": "50\nHero. Nihlathak did this to me!\n \nIf you've come to help me, my only hope \nlies with Malah.\n \nPlease...Tell her you've found me...\n",
 "A5Q3SuccessfulMalah": "48\nThank you so much for bringing Anya \nback to us. I have devised this spell to \nincrease your resistances as a token of \nmy thanks. I know it isn't much, but I \nhope you find it helpful.\n \nPlease go talk to Anya. She has urgent \nnews concerning Nihlathak.\n",
 "A5Q3SuccessfulCain": "62\nFor one so young, Anya commands \ngreat respect. Now that she is here, I \nwill make it a point to talk to her about \nMount Arreat.\n \nYou should do the same.\n",
 "A5Q3SuccessfulLarzuk": "67\nI never liked Nihlathak, but I never \nsuspected that he'd betray us! I just \ncan't understand how an Elder could do \nsuch a thing.\n",
 "A5Q3SuccessfulQualKehk": "140\nYour rescue of Anya was quite an \naccomplishment.\n",
 "A5Q3SuccessfulAnya": "80\nThank you, hero, for rescuing me.\n \nTo show my personal gratitude, I give \nyou this. I had it custom-made for you \nby Larzuk.\n",
 "A5Q4InitAnya": "43\nNihlathak told me he struck a deal with \nBaal to protect Harrogath. In exchange \nfor the demon's mercy, the misguided \nfool plans to give Baal the Relic of the \nAncients, our most holy totem!\n \nDoing so will allow Baal to enter Mount \nArreat unchallenged by the Ancients. I \ntried to stop Nihlathak, but he \nimprisoned me in that icy tomb.\n \nNihlathak must be stopped before he \ndooms the whole world. As much as I \nwould love to strangle the life out of \nhim, I'm afraid I haven't the strength.\n \nYou must go to his lair through this \nportal I've opened, kill him, and then \nbring back the Relic of the Ancients.\n \nStop Nihlathak from destroying what we \nhave striven for eons to protect.\n",
 "A5Q4AfterInitAnya": "90\nAs noble as Nihlathak's intentions are, \nnothing can excuse his actions.\n",
 "A5Q4AfterInitCain": "50\nRegretfully, I know very little about this \nRelic. However, if what the others say \nis true, then Baal must not gain \npossession of it.\n \nStop Nihlathak...before all is lost.\n",
 "A5Q4AfterInitMalah": "65\nMy worst fear has come true. Nihlathak \nhas gone mad.\n \nYou must stop him, before he gives the \nRelic to the Lord of Destruction!\n",
 "A5Q4AfterInitLarzuk": "56\nNow, rescuing Anya -- that's good. \nTalking to me while Nihlathak hands \nover the Relic to Baal -- uh...that's bad!\n",
 "A5Q4AfterInitQualKehk": "60\nI saw Nihlathak leave town just before \nyou found Anya. He must be held \naccountable for his criminal deeds.\n \nFind him and bring him back, if you can. \nLikely, he won't come willingly, and \nyou'll be forced to kill him.\n \nSo be it.\n",
 "A5Q4EarlyReturnAnya": "55\nNihlathak is a traitor! If Baal gets the \nRelic, he shall enter the mountain and \nwreak havoc there!\n \nI cannot believe that Nihlathak would \ngive the Relic to Baal in any kind of \ntrade. He's truly insane if he believes \nthat he can deal with the Lord of \nDestruction.\n",
 "A5Q4EarlyReturnCain": "58\nOhh...This is a truly horrible turn of \nevents.\n \nI know it seems you have always been \none step behind, my friend. But look at \nit this way...You have evil on the run.\n",
 "A5Q4EarlyReturnLarzuk": "160\n...What's there to talk about?\n \nKill Nihlathak!\n",
 "A5Q4EarlyReturnMalah": "63\nNihlathak was never the kindest man. \nBut for him to betray the whole world...\n \nAhh...Where shall his soul finally rest?\n",
 "A5Q4EarlyReturnQualKehk": "65\nMy advice is to go in quick and hit hard. \nNihlathak can't be half as tough as the \nbeasts you've faced out there.\n",
 "A5Q4SuccessfulAnya": "55\nYou have stopped Nihlathak, but he \ndidn't have the Relic! He must have \nalready given it to Baal. Now, Baal will \nnot be tested when he reaches Arreat's \nsummit.\n \n...Damn Nihlathak!\n \nI do thank you for trying, though. \nPlease, allow me to honor your courage \nby magically inscribing your name onto \nan item of your choosing. It's the least \nI can do.\n",
 "A5Q4SuccessfulCain": "90\nBeware! Baal grows stronger with every \npassing moment.\n",
 "A5Q4SuccessfulLarzuk": "93\nHmmm...What does Baal plan to do \ninside Mount Arreat?\n",
 "A5Q4SuccessfulMalah": "65\nSo, the Relic is lost. Do not dwell on \nfailures past. It is your future that \nmatters more.\n",
 "A5Q4SuccessfulQualKehk": "57\nNihlathak was a vile demon that shall \nfind his home among the tortured \nminions of Hell!\n \nYou battled the Darkness without fear. I \nlaud your skill and courage.\n",
 "A5Q5InitQualKehk": "37\nEvery time I hear of you, warrior, your \ndeeds become more legendary.\n \nBut take heed. You are approaching the \nvery summit of Mount Arreat. I have \nnever dared venture there. It is sacred \n-- our most holy place. The legends say \nit is guarded by the Ancient Ones, who \nblock the path of all who are unworthy.\n \nYour reputation here does not \nmatter...It will be the Ancients who \ndetermine your worthiness.\n \nGood luck.\n",
 "A5Q5AfterInitQualKehk": "63\nThe Ancients are not our enemies. \nRemember that! They are our \nancestors -- our gods.\n",
 "A5Q5AfterInitCain": "90\nA test of mettle is a fitting rite of \npassage for a Barbarian hero.\n",
 "A5Q5AfterInitAnya": "72\nYou wouldn't have to test yourself \nagainst the Ancients if it weren't for \nNihlathak's treachery. He was a fool \nand deserves to suffer for eternity.\n",
 "A5Q5AfterInitLarzuk": "75\nEvery night, I've prayed to the Ancients \nto bring us peace...and now you must \nfight them.\n \nHuh...Who shall I pray to now, warrior?\n",
 "A5Q5AfterInitMalah": "65\nBy reaching the summit, you cease \nbeing just a simple warrior. When you \ncome back, you will be far more.\n",
 "A5Q5EarlyReturnQualKehk": "114\nI warned you!\n \nThe Ancients are not like the demons \nyou're accustomed to fighting.\n",
 "A5Q5EarlyReturnCain": "52\nWe have come too far to be defeated \nnow, my friend. I have seen you \ncomplete many difficult quests. Though \nthis may be your greatest trial, it is not \nbeyond your reach.\n",
 "A5Q5EarlyReturnAnya": "71\nLook. I must apologize.\n \nI feel responsible for your current \nstruggle. If I had only stopped \nNihlathak from giving Baal the Relic, \nyou would not have to fight those \nghosts.\n",
 "A5Q5EarlyReturnLarzuk": "70\nYou've walked on the burial grounds of \nour greatest ancestors. I'm not sure \nwhether I should bow before you or \nrevile you for committing sacrilege.\n \nTread lightly when you walk with gods.\n",
 "A5Q5EarlyReturnMalah": "68\nDo not doubt yourself. I believe you are \nworthy to pass through the Ancients' \ngates, but you must believe, as well.\n",
 "A5Q5SuccessfulQualKehk": "75\nBesting the Ancients in battle is a \nmighty feat indeed. I hope this means \nyou're ready to battle Baal.\n",
 "A5Q5SuccessfulCain": "67\nYou have proven yourself to these \npeople. They look to you as their \nwarrior, their champion.\n",
 "A5Q5SuccessfulAnya": "82\nYou stand before me a worthy hero -- \nand on you rests the last hope of our \npeople.\n \nBear it well, warrior.\n",
 "A5Q5SuccessfulLarzuk": "82\nThe Ancients have honored you, and in \nturn, so do we. I have no remaining \ndoubts about you, now.\n",
 "A5Q5SuccessfulMalah": "60\nI knew the Ancients would find you \nworthy of Mount Arreat's secrets. Now, \nstop Baal before he destroys all that is \nsacred.\n",
 "A5Q6InitAncients": "31\nYou are a worthy hero! We augment \nyour skill and grant you entry to the \ninterior of Mount Arreat, wherein lies \nthe Worldstone.\n \nBeware. You will not be alone. Baal the \nLord of Destruction is already inside. \n \nThe Archangel Tyrael has always been \nour benefactor, but even he cannot \nhelp us now. For Baal blocks Tyrael's \nspiritual presence from entering the \nchamber of the Worldstone. Only you, \nmortal, have the power to defeat Baal \nnow.\n \nBaal threatens the Worldstone -- and \nthrough it, the mortal realm, itself. You \nmust stop him before he gains full \ncontrol of the sacred stone. With it \nunder his control, Baal could shatter \nthe boundaries between this world and \nthe Burning Hells, thus allowing the \nhordes of the Prime Evils to pour forth \ninto the mortal realm like an \nunstoppable tide!\n \nIf you are weak, the world as you know \nit could be lost forever. You must NOT \nfail!\n",
 "A5Q6EarlyReturnCain": "51\nRemember this. Baal once possessed Tal \nRasha, one of the most powerful of the \nancient Horadrim.\n \nYour battles with Mephisto and Diablo \nwill pale in comparison to your battle \nwith Baal.\n \nThe Lord of Destruction aided by Tal \nRasha's knowledge...The mountain \nitself will tremble when you clash.\n",
 "A5Q6EarlyReturnLarzuk": "59\nI may be just an armorer, but I know \nthis...Baal plans to destroy the world \nwith the secrets contained in that \nmountain. It doesn't take a genius to \nknow he has to be stopped.\n",
 "A5Q6EarlyReturnMalah": "70\nYou knew it would eventually come down \nto this. Kill Baal! Finish the game!\n",
 "A5Q6EarlyReturnAnya": "60\nBaal has blocked Tyrael from entering \nthe Worldstone Chamber? This truly \nhas become a battle against Hell.\n \nWhether or not it was the Heavens' \ndecree, this is your fight now -- your \ndestiny.\n",
 "A5Q6EarlyReturnQualKehk": "63\nYou have ventured to a place beyond \nlegend. You rush to face an evil few \ncan even imagine.\n \nBe careful, my friend, and may the Light \nwatch over you.\n",
 "A5Q6SuccessfulTyrael": "40\nI am impressed, mortal. You have \novercome the greatest challenge this \nworld has ever faced and defeated the \nlast of the Prime Evils. However, we are \ntoo late to save the Worldstone. Baal's \ndestructive touch has corrupted it \ncompletely.\n \nGiven enough time, the Worldstone's \nenergies will drain away and the \nbarriers between the worlds will \nshatter -- the powers of Hell will flood \ninto this...Sanctuary...and eradicate \nyour people and everything you've \nlabored to build.\n \nTherefore, I must destroy the corrupted \nWorldstone before the powers of Hell \ntake root. This act will change your \nworld forever -- with consequences \neven I cannot foresee. However, it is \nthe only way to ensure mankind's \nsurvival.\n \nGo now, mortal. I have opened a portal \nthat will lead you to safety.\n \nMay the Eternal Light shine upon you \nand your descendants for what you've \ndone this day. The continued survival \nof mankind is your legacy! Above all \nelse, you have earned a rest from this \nendless battle.\n",
 "A5Q6SuccessfulAnya": "53\nYou have done the impossible, hero. \nYour defeat of the last of the three \nPrime Evils is a great victory for the \nLight. \n \nStrange that you say that the \nWorldstone must be destroyed. The \nprophecies said nothing about that.\n \nPerhaps all we have fought for will be \nlost...or perhaps we'll never need fight \nagain!\n",
 "A5Q6SuccessfulCain": "40\nI knew in time you would defeat Baal. \nYou have done everything you set out \nto do, my friend.\n \nEver since you rescued me from \nTristram, I have believed in you. It has \nbeen a supreme honor to aid you along \nthe way. \n \nSo...The Worldstone was corrupted by \nBaal. And now Tyrael must destroy it. \nWorry not. Through whatever lies \nahead I have faith that the Light will \nguide us both.\n \nGo, now, back to the Worldstone \nchamber, and enter the portal Tyrael \nhas opened for you.\n",
 "A5Q6SuccessfulLarzuk": "74\nThe Ancients themselves will envy our \nsongs about you.\n \nPlease, don't forget about us! Farewell, \nmy friend.\n",
 "A5Q6SuccessfulMalah": "48\nIf Tyrael says the Worldstone must be \ndestroyed, then it must. We cannot let \nBaal's corruption prevail!\n \nThe world will change, true -- but who is \nto say it isn't for the better?\n",
 "A5Q6SuccessfulQualKehk": "60\nThe destruction of the Worldstone does \nnot bode well for our world. But I'll try \nnot to worry...\n \nAfter all, we have warriors like you \nfighting for us and for the Light.\n \nFarewell!\n",
